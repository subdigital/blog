<p>The very best resource I have found so far about working with CAB are the <a title="Microsoft - CAB Hands on Labs" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=ab44f082-3abe-4583-8844-7252ff7c9638&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank">Hands On Labs</a>.</p><p>For some reason they were very difficult to find for me.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re looking to understand CAB from a very beginner&rsquo;s perspective, then I highly recommend you go through them.&nbsp; There are 9 in total.</p>
