I was browsing some high resolution dual &amp; tri screen monitor wallpapers at <a href="http://wallpaper.panedia.com/">http://wallpaper.panedia.com/</a> and I noticed something really cool.&nbsp; They looked at my user agent string and resolution settings to determine which wallpaper was best for me.<br><br>Considering that (without 3rd party add ons) Windows can't display more than 1 image on multi-monitor setups, you have to choose 1 large image.&nbsp; They were nice enough to highlight the correct resolution as well.&nbsp; Kudos to Panedia for that!<br><br><br><p></p><img src="http://flux88.com/content/binary/wallpaper-autodetect-resolution.png" border="0"><br><br><i>(note:&nbsp; there were a ton of sizes available, my highlighted suggestion was way at the bottom)</i><br>
