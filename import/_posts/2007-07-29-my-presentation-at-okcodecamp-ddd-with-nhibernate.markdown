<p>I presented a talk on Domain Driven Design with NHibernate at the OKC code camp yesterday.</p><p>It started out a bit rough because I had some missing references and some confusing exceptions, however once I got the ball rolling I think it went pretty well.</p><p>I ran way short on time, however, and I promised the crowd that I would post the completed files on my blog tonight <img src="/images/smile1________________________________.gif"   />.</p><p>So, here is the powerpoint, demo applications, and all of the referenced dlls from my presentation.&nbsp; Let me hear your feedback in the comments!</p><p><a href="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/ddd_20with_20nhibernate.zip" target="_blank">File Attachment: ddd with nhibernate.zip (7694 KB)</a></p><p>(the file is large because I have the complete references to specific versions of NHibernate and NUnit, so you shouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about references at all.)</p><p>To get the sample running, change the app.config to point to an actual database.&nbsp; The database should be empty.</p><div class="bjtags">Tags:<a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/Presentations">Presentations</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/NUnit">NUnit</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/NHibernate">NHibernate</a></div>
