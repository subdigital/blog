<p>I have gone on record and said before that TFS Source Control is a great step up from VSS, however I&rsquo;d never want to be constrained to the IDE for my SCC tasks.&nbsp; Granted, IDE integration is a nice <em>feature</em>, but it shouldn&rsquo;t be your sole interface.</p><p>This is part of the reason that I love Subversion.&nbsp; It has builtin command line support for the freaks out there (like me) who like to type.&nbsp; TortoiseSVN gives us explorer integration, which is solid gold.&nbsp; Then there&rsquo;s AnkhSVN for the IDE integration.&nbsp; See a pattern here?</p><p>So I just stumbled on a new TFS Source Control explorer plugin tool with a funny name.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s called <a href="http://blog.benday.com/archive/2007/05/18/23006.aspx" target="_blank">Dubbelbock TFS</a>&nbsp;and it was written by a friend of mine, Ben Day.</p><p>This is the kind of tool that will help bring the power of TFS source control out of the IDE and enable a much more usable and powerful experience.</p><p>So go out and buy a copy, it&rsquo;s only $25 (I think).&nbsp; And tell Ben I sent you.</p><div class="bjtags">Tags:<a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/TFS">TFS</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/SourceControl">SourceControl</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/Tools">Tools</a></div>
