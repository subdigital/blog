<p>Austin Code Camp 08 was a success, and I&rsquo;m really glad I participated in it.&nbsp; About 150&ndash;200 eager developers came to learn and network with others from around the area.</p><p>I was able to attend 2 sessions, the first was &ldquo;Agile in the Enterprise&rdquo; by <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/members/agilejoe.aspx" target="_blank">Joe Ocampo</a>.&nbsp; His talk was full of a ton of powerpoint slides which really didn&rsquo;t fit in with the size of the talk.&nbsp; Here are a few highlights:</p><ul><li>What makes success?&nbsp; -&gt; People, Communication</li><li>What makes failure? -&gt;&nbsp;People, Communication</li><li>People are often overlooked as critical factors of success of any project.</li><li>&ldquo;The worst thing you can do is isolate architects from developers.&rdquo;&nbsp; &mdash; I couldn&rsquo;t agree more.&nbsp; </li><li>Siloed teams lead to lack of communication, trust.&nbsp; Change is very difficult.</li><li>Composite teams are cross-functional &ndash; based on component, feature, subsystem, interface</li><li>Agile projects will generally cost MORE &mdash; <em>I can&rsquo;t say I fully agree with this</em></li><li>However, ROI can be realized much sooner, which can help overcome that cost</li><li>In a waterfall project, technical debt is incurred and generally not paid back.&nbsp; Leads to lower pace and more costly maintencance.</li><li>In an agile project, technical debt is minimized, keeping a sustainable pace and enabling change without high cost</li><li>&ldquo;Innovation Games&rdquo; &mdash; to help you drive out features/priority with your customer</li></ul><p>Some pics:</p><p><img src="/images/iphone_20032_small_.jpg" alt="Iphone 032"  border="0"  /></p><p><img src="/images/iphone_20033_small_.jpg" alt="Iphone 033"  border="0"  /></p><p>Next I went to a talk entitled &ldquo;Designing for Stupid Users&rdquo; which was a fantastic title.&nbsp; The talk was about User Experience Design and I found it to be informative but a bit dry.&nbsp; The speaker obviously knew the topic well and could speak to it, but the power point slides where just loaded with text.</p><p>There was a great picture on his deck though:</p><p><img src="/images/iphone_20036_small_.jpg" alt="Iphone 036"  border="0"  /></p><p>Basically (it&rsquo;s hard to read) it says the left most &ldquo;thing&rdquo; that the users interact with is the screen.&nbsp; They then go through many different layers of &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; to get to their overall goal, which is a business action.</p><p>The rest of the day was me speaking, and I think they all went very well.&nbsp; I did notice, however, that the DDD with NHibernate is just too much material to fit into an hour.&nbsp;&nbsp;I should have submitted these as 2 sessions.&nbsp; I also ran out of time in the Advanced CSS &amp; Javascript talk and didn&rsquo;t get to demo much javascript.</p><p>All in all, it was a great event, I got to meet a lot of very cool people and I learned a bunch as well.</p><p>Thanks to all who organized, spoke, or attended the event!&nbsp; It was awesome.</p><p>To end the evening, we went to have beers at a nice place.&nbsp; Scott Bellware showed up and we had some really good conversations about community.</p><p><img src="/images/iphone_20038_small_.jpg" alt="Iphone 038"  border="0"  /></p><p><img src="/images/iphone_20039_small_.jpg" alt="Iphone 039"  border="0"  /></p><p>And then I made my journey back to Houston and slept for 10 hours.&nbsp; <img src="/images/smile3___.gif"   /></p><p>(oh, and you can download all of the material from the code camp at their <a href="http://code.google.com/p/austincodecamp08/" target="_blank">google code repository</a>)</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
