InfoQ has published a small book on DDD called <u><b>Domain Driven Design Quickly</b></u>.&nbsp; They're giving away the PDF for free!&nbsp; The print version is only $22, so I'll probably buy it if I like the PDF version.<br><br>Check it out:<br>http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/domain-driven-design-quickly<br><p></p>
