<p>Last week I gave my two weeks notice to my employer, <a href="http://www.us.sogeti.com" target="_blank">Sogeti</a>.&#160; I’ve been working there since 2006 (when we were Software Architects, or Sark) and have many fond memories.&#160; I’ve grown considerably as a software developer these past 4 years, and I’ve had the opportunity to work in many cool fields such as:</p>  <ul>   <li>Offshore Drilling</li>    <li>Call out systems for after-hours emergency response</li>    <li>Smart Electric Metering Systems</li> </ul>  <p>I think Sogeti is a great place to work and I would encourage anyone coming into this field to consider them.</p>  <h2>So why am I leaving? </h2>  <p>   <br /> There are a few reasons.&#160; Mostly it is just time for me.</p>  <ul>   <li><strong>Vendor-slavery</strong>.&#160; I am not at all interested in latching myself to SharePoint, PerformancePoint, BizTalk, any of Oracle’s army of tools, IBM WebSphere whatever, or anything of the sort.&#160; It seems like this is a huge focus for the company and I couldn’t be less enthusiastic about such products.&#160; </li>    <li><strong>Agile?</strong>&#160; I’m keenly interested in agile software development, specifically Scrum and XP.&#160; Every project I’ve worked on I’ve met friction trying to introduce these things.&#160; It’s not like agile isn’t welcomed, it’s just really only considered if a client is clamoring for it.</li>    <li><strong>TFS TFS TFS</strong>.&#160; Seriously.&#160; This is a real reason.&#160; It might be good for some folks, but in my mind, life’s too short to learn to cope with the barrage of mini-frustrations that TFS brings.</li>    <li><strong>Cubicle-land</strong> is taxing on my soul.&#160; I’ve spent a long time in a gray carpeted building and it really weakens the morale.&#160; I’m looking forward to having a place (that isn’t temporary) that I can call my own and hang pictures of my awesome family up.</li>    <li>I’m becoming more and more interested in rails, Git, iPhone development, etc.&#160; This stuff isn’t really on the radar at my current employer.</li> </ul>  <h2>So where am I going?</h2>  <p><img style="margin: 0px 0px 5px; display: inline" align="right" src="http://www.chaione.com/wp-content/themes/chaione-rebrand/09-images/logo.gif" /></p>  <p>I’m joining <a href="http://chaione.com" target="_blank">ChaiONE</a>, a local web/iPhone firm here in Houston.&#160; I’ll be joining as Director of Development, leading the web &amp; iPhone teams.&#160; My role will be focused on choosing the technology direction for the company, leading the design &amp; architecture of our products, and spending a lot of time in code.&#160; It’s a much smaller company, where I’ll have a lot of responsibility and a lot of freedom to build out some excellent software using tools and technique that I know to work well.</p>  <p>I’ll be using a range of platforms and languages, such as .NET (Monorail / MVC, NHibernate, etc), Ruby (Rails), and iPhone (obj-c / MonoTouch).&#160; They currently use SVN, but I think I’ll start planting the Git seed.&#160; Either way, I’m happy to be off TFS.</p>  <p>Oh yeah, did I mention?&#160; I’ll be using a Mac.&#160; :)</p>  <p>I start on February 1, and I’m very excited to turn this page in my life.</p>
