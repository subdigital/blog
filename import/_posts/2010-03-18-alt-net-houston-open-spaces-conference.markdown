<p><a href="http://altnethouston.com" target="_blank"><img src="/images/logo.png" alt="altnethouston 2010"   /> </a></p> It’s that time of year again!&#160; Last year we held our first <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology" target="_blank">open spaces</a> conference and I was quite pleased with the results.&#160; We had 120 people show up and it was really rewarding to&#160; see the entire thing take shape.&#160; You can see the photos from last year <a href="http://altnethouston/#photos" target="_blank">here</a>.  <p></p>  <p>I proposed this question to the group at the end of the conference:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><strong>Should we do this again next year?</strong></p> </blockquote>  <p>The response was a resounding <strong>YES</strong>.</p>  <h3>When is it?&#160; What’s the schedule like?</h3>  <p>This year the conference will be held from <strong>Friday, April 30th – Sunday, May 2nd</strong>.&#160; We’re adding Friday (starting at noon) for workshops.&#160; We will have 2 concurrent 4 hour workshops that you can attend if you like.&#160; The topic for these workshops is still to be determined, but if you have some suggestions on what you’d like to see, please leave a comment.</p>  <p>Friday evening we will hold the planning session, where we will all gather and suggest topics that we either want to present/convene, or that we’d like to hear about.&#160; This is an important part of the event.&#160; <em>Your satisfaction with the conference is completely in your hands.&#160; </em>So come on Friday and make your voice heard.</p>  <p>Saturday &amp; Sunday will be full of sessions, open-space style.</p>  <h3>Where is it?</h3>  <p>Microsoft has graciously opened up their office in Houston for us to hold the event in.&#160; Last year we found the space to be just right for the number of attendees.&#160; The office is located in West Houston.</p>  <h3>Who’s facilitating?</h3>  <p>We’re very fortunate to have <a href="http://stevenlist.com/" target="_blank">Doc List</a> as our facilitator again this year.</p>  <h3>How much is it?</h3>  <p>The cost is $20, which helps us cover breakfast, lunch, and drinks.&#160; We (the organizers) feel that $20 is not really a barrier for most people, and helps keep people honest (less no-shows).&#160; There is one exception, however, and that is for students.&#160; <strong>We want students to attend</strong>!&#160; If you’re a student, please reach out to me directly before registering.</p>  <h3>How do I register?</h3>  <p>You can register on the <a href="http://altnethouston.com" target="_blank">ALT.NET Houston website</a>.&#160; The time is fast approaching and we have a cap of 120 attendees, so what are you waiting for?&#160; <a href="http://altnethouston.com/#registration" target="_blank">Register now</a>!</p>
