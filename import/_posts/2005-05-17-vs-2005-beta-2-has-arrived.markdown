<div style="clear:both;"></div>I walked in my office today and opened the yellow envelope on the floor by the door to find:<br /><br /><ul> <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Visual Studio 2005 Beta 2</span> - Team Suite CD</li> <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Visual Studio 2005 Beta 2</span> - Team Foundation Server</li> <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">SQL Server 2005 </span>Developer Edition - 365 day trial</li> </ul> Now I have to find the time to reformat my machine because there is no way I am installing anything heavy on it right now... it's running too slow.<br /><br />Why in the world does VS2003 start moving like molasses after a couple months of use?When I add a new item to my solution I have to wait 3 full minutes before I regain control of the computer...how <span style="font-style: italic;">ghey</span>.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
