<p>I was telling people in <a href="http://http://flux88.com/NETDojoAugustsALTNETGeekDinner.aspx" target="_blank">yesterday's .NET Dojo class</a> that we should expect preview 5 any time now.&nbsp; It looks like it was released as I was saying that yesterday!</p> <p>I haven't yet downloaded it to convert my projects over, but the release note highlights are:</p> <ul> <li><em>Html Helpers need to look into ModelState to get attempted value </em> <li><em>Add a convenience overload for Html.ActionLink </em> <li><em>Need friendly exception for UpdateModel type conversion errors. </em> <li><em>UpdateModel needs to report a message when a property setter throws an exception </em></li></ul> <p>Grab it here:&nbsp; <a title="http://www.codeplex.com/aspnet/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=16775#ReleaseFiles" href="http://www.codeplex.com/aspnet/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=16775#ReleaseFiles">http://www.codeplex.com/aspnet/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=16775#ReleaseFiles</a></p>
