<P>Well Houston is definitely panicked.&nbsp; I didn't want to be around a mob of lunatics, so we packed up our stuff and went to Dallas via Bellville, Brenham, Temple and Waco, which turned out to be a huge success.&nbsp; We made it to Dallas safely in 6 hours, which was much more desirable than the 24 hour wait on I45.</P><P>I hope everyone in Houston is safe, because it's going to be incredibly difficult to get out of the city now.&nbsp; I'm glad we left when we did.</P>
