<p>Thanks to HDNUG for inviting me to speak again.&nbsp; I always enjoy it.&nbsp; The crowd was a little thin this time around, but I think that's because the website wasn't updated with the meeting information in time.</p> <p>I spoke about latest updates to the ASP.NET MVC Framework, and did some off-the-cuff coding to demonstrate the features.&nbsp; I didn't get a chance to touch on a few subjects, but all in all I think it was well received.</p> <p>I made the point early on that ASP.NET MVC is an option, and that not everyone would get it.&nbsp; That's fine!&nbsp; It's meant for a specific type of developer who cares deeply about certain things, namely control over HTML, URLS, tight integration with HTTP and Javascript, and ajax.&nbsp; And who can possibly leave out better separation of concerns &amp; testability.</p> <p><img src="/images/mvc-an-option_3_.png" alt="mvc-an-option"  border="0" /> </p> <p>There were certainly folks in the camp that didn't get it in the audience.&nbsp; I hope that I adequately represented what MVC is and how it works well on ASP.NET.</p> <p>You can <a href="http://benscheirman.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/presentations/hdnug%20%2001-2009/hdnug%2009.pptx" target="_blank">download the slides for the talk</a>, however I am unable to post the code because it references a private release that I cannot distribute.&nbsp; As soon as the RC becomes available, I'll post the code online.</p>
