<p>I just discovered this today:</p><p><a href="http://www.songbirdnest.com/">http://www.songbirdnest.com/</a></p><p><img alt="" src="http://www.songbirdnest.com/themes/gespaa_customized/main_screenshot_small.png" border="0" /></p><p>It&rsquo;s called Songbird and I think they&rsquo;re on to something.&nbsp; Just admit it:&nbsp; Our current media situation sucks.&nbsp; I posted about this previously and ranted about how much I hate most media players.&nbsp; Anyway, I settled for iTunes, but not because I love it, only because it&rsquo;s the lesser of other evils (IMHO).</p><p>Songbird is taking a different approach to media players, integrating it more closely with the web, and it&rsquo;s built on top of Firefox, so it&rsquo;s cross-platform and have rich plugin support.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m really looking forward to some of the extensions that will become of this.</p><p>It&rsquo;s based on XUL, which should impress some super-techies out there <img src="/images/smile1_______________.gif"   />.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wonder how nicely this will work with a distributed scenario like iTunes + FolderShare?</p>
