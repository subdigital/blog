<p>I never got around to blogging this, but a few weeks ago I created my first iPad app (it's a universal binary, so it works on iPhone as well).</p>
<p>It's called GiggleTouch and it's $0.99, available on the Apple App Store.</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<p style="margin: 10px"><a href="http://itunes.com/apps/GiggleTouch" target="_blank"><img src="/images/giggletouch-ipad-icon.png"  alt="giggletouch-ipad-icon.png"  /> <img src="/images/appStoreBadge.png"  alt="GiggleTouch App Store link"  /></a></p>
</div>
<p>So, what is it? GiggleTouch is simply an app for young children. My 1-year-old twins love it. So do toddlers. Usage is simple: Touch it and shapes &amp; letters animated in various colors &amp; sizes. What really makes it fun is the giggling. It's somewhat contagious, and after watching about a dozen kids play with this app, I'm convinced you'll like it too (if you have kids).</p>
<p>Just today I found out that GiggleTouch is featured in the What's Hot section on the iPad App Store. Woot!<img src="/images/giggletouch-featured-photo.png"  style="margin-top:10px; margin-right:10px; margin-bottom:10px; margin-left:10px;"  /></p>
<p>If you do end up snagging it, I'd love a review.<br /></p>
