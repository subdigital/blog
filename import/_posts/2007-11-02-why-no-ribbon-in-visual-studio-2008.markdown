Yesterday I was getting frustrated with the completely user-unfriendly massive toolbar that Visual Studio boasts, and noted that Visual Studio 2008 *should* have gotten the ribbon toolbar that shipped with Office 2007.&nbsp; My cube-mate <a href="http://www.pseale.com/blog" target="_blank">Peter</a>&nbsp;said, <blockquote>"They'd probably get sued by the Office Team."</blockquote><p>Well said, my friend.&nbsp; They probably would.&nbsp; <em>For "Toolbar Infringement."</em>&nbsp;</p>
