<p>I spoke at iPhone Dev Con in Boston last week and I attended Mike Lee's excellent keynote presentation: "Mariachi Product Engineering"</p>
<p>At iPhone Dev Con in San Diego last year, Mike came out dressed like a Pirate. No kidding.</p>

<p>This year he came with a Mariachi outfit on. It's pretty hilarious as nobody expects a keynote speaker to be dressed this way.</p>
<p>Over beers some of the guys at the conference decided it would be awesomely-epic to hire a real mariachi band to play during his keynote. So how does one find a mariachi band with after midnight on a Monday? Apparently, AMEX. One of the guys called his AMEX service and they <i>delivered</i>. I swear this could be the makings of a new AMEX commercial.</p>
<p>It made for a memorable keynote to say the least. The talk was excellent as well, as Mike certainly has a lot to say about Product Engineering.</p>
<p>Here is the video of the first 30 or so minutes of the talk (I ran out of battery before it was over).</p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/22031658" width="400" height="300" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>I'll have links to my presentation material soon, but I wanted to share this awesome event. Certainly one for the books!</p>
