<p>Since <a href="http://apple.com/safari">Safari 5</a> was released I decided to set it as the default browser for a week and see how I liked it.  Previously my default was Firefox, but mainly because the developer tools are so kick ass with it.  Chrome is nice and fast (and I use it still), but doesn't feel like a Mac app and I was seriously missing the 1 Password extension (until I found it the other day!).</p>
<p>Safari 5 definitely feels like a Mac app, is as fast as Chrome (so they say) and has extension support.  Yay!</p>
<p>Anyway, I noticed that Safari would show a "Reader" button on some websites.  Clicking it gives you a nice, friendly, easy to read view of the page, sans dancing bunnies, rollover ads, and other cruft that makes the internet annoying.  Check it out:</p>
