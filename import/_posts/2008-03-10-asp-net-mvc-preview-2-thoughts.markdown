<p>I said previously that I was excited for this release.&nbsp; Ultimately I didn&rsquo;t see much worth blogging about.&nbsp; Some features are a step in the right direction, some (I think) were a step back.</p><p>I&rsquo;m currently upgrade <a href="http://codecampserver.org/" target="_blank">Code Camp Server</a> to Preview 2 and hit about 80 errors which I had to go in and resolve.&nbsp; My initial thoughts:</p><ul><li>I think the HttpContextBase is a bad idea.&nbsp; Yes I understand the desire to not introduce breaking changes.&nbsp; But I think that the people that will be using ASP.NET MVC will be congnizant of this and code appropriately.&nbsp; Interfaces are much easier to depend work with while testing, and I&rsquo;d rather just use those.&nbsp; Hey, couldn&rsquo;t they give us both, and framework providers could choose?<br /></li><li>what&rsquo;s up with the <strong>OnActionExecuting</strong>, <strong>OnActionExecuted</strong> events?&nbsp; These used to be <strong>OnPreAction</strong>, <strong>OnPostAction</strong>, which was much more readable (in my opinion) &mdash; seriously, put these back!&nbsp; The new naming is not nearly as obvious to the glance.<br /></li><li>Testing is still too cumbersome.&nbsp; I think some good mocking-fu can mitigate this, but it&rsquo;s a tough sell to people new to unit testing (and to mocking).&nbsp; TempData should be implemented as an IDictionary on the controller, only to have a real TempData that depends on session state at runtime.&nbsp; This would allow me to test that TempData works without having to mock session (which is not intuitive at all).<br /></li><li>The Action filters are going to be where the goo lives.&nbsp; This is how we will see some really productive &amp; handy filters for performing actions such as requiring SSL, protecting an action from unauthenticated access, loading common data, etc.&nbsp; Think of them as HttpModules for individual actions.</li></ul><p>More to come, I&rsquo;m sure&hellip;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
