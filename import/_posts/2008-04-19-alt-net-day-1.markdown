<p>I&rsquo;m up here in Redmond for the the 2<sup>nd</sup> ALT.NET Open Spaces gathering.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.flux88.com/ALTNETGoodness.aspx" target="_blank">The first one was truly a great event</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately I flew up Friday afternoon and missed the Friday night fish-bowl session.&nbsp; I had to miss this last year as well, and next time I want&nbsp;to come up early enough to participate.&nbsp; The fish-bowl session (from what I gather) is a rount-table discussion about the topics that should be covered in the open space the following 2 days.&nbsp; If you want to learn about F# or Git, shout it out!&nbsp; If you want to talk about jQuery or BDD, then let it be known.&nbsp; People gravitate to the good ideas and that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s covered.</p><p>I decided to rent a car and drive to my hotel.&nbsp;&nbsp; I figured it would be cheaper than taking a taxi and easier than bumming rides off of others.&nbsp; I checked in and quickly headed over to DigiPen, where the conference is being held.&nbsp; Stupid me, I forgot my jacket and it was snowing!&nbsp; I ran into Eddie Bauer next to the hotel and picked up a jacket to keep me warm.</p><p><img src="/images/IMG_0196_small1.jpg" hspace="10"  border="0"  /></p><p>The campus is next to Nintendo, as you can see in the picture.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve heard that DigiPen graduates are guaranteed internships at Nintendo.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s awesome.</p><p>I ran into <a href="http://www.persistall.com/" target="_blank">Brian Donahue</a>, <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/david_laribee/" target="_blank">Dave Laribee</a>, <a href="http://www.jamesthigpen.com/" target="_blank">James Thigpen</a>, <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/raymond.lewallen/" target="_blank">Raymond Lewallen</a> at the front.&nbsp; Inside the main room there were about 120 geeks all chatting intensely.&nbsp; I glanced around and saw many known faces in the industry.</p><p>After a while a bunch of us headed over to Desert Fire, a southwestern grill near the hotel.&nbsp; The room was probably going to exceed fire code and would definitely impede us getting some much needed food (and beer!) so a few of us decided to go get a different table.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re on twitter, then check out the hashtag #altdotnet to see the live tweets about the conference.&nbsp; For me, I don&rsquo;t do much mobile tweeting, but I might post a thing or 2 during the day, so follow @subdigital if you&rsquo;re on twitter.&nbsp; Here is <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeffrey.palermo" target="_blank">Jeffrey</a> twittering on his phone at the restaurant:</p><p><img src="/images/IMG_0197_small1.jpg" hspace="10"  border="0"  /></p><p>Next to Jeffrey was <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jean-paul_boodhoo/default.aspx" target="_blank">Jean Paul Boodhoo</a>, who was chilling out with a large glass of milk:</p><p><img src="/images/IMG_0198_small.jpg" alt="IMG_0198"  border="0"  /></p><p>Here is the rest of the table:</p><p><img src="/images/IMG_0199_small.jpg" hspace="10"  border="0"  /></p><p>There&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/evan_hoff/" target="_blank">Evan Hoff</a>, <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/chris_patterson/" target="_blank">Chris Patterson</a>, <a href="http://haveyougotwoods.com/" target="_blank">Dave Woods</a>&nbsp;<strike>(forgot your last name!)</strike>, <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/dsellers/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Dru Sellers</a> (behind Dave), and one of Chris&rsquo; co-workers, (I forgot your name as well!).</p><p>After dinner it was drinks and geek discussion in Phatboyg&rsquo;s hotel room.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s the night&rsquo;s progression:</p><p><img src="/images/IMG_0200_small.jpg" hspace="10"  border="0"  /></p><p><img src="/images/IMG_0202_small.jpg" hspace="10"  border="0"  /></p><p>(luckily only 2 of those were mine, otherwise I&rsquo;d be hurting this morning!)</p><p>ALT.NET day one was pretty fun, but I&rsquo;m looking forward day 2.&nbsp; Right now I&rsquo;m off to eat breakfast with some people at Ruby&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Until next time!</p><div class="bjtags">Tags:<a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/altdotnet">altdotnet</a></div>
