<p>Me, My wife, and daughter went to go see Blue October play at the Sam Houston Race Park.&nbsp; It was my 2<sup>nd</sup> time to see the band (the first being at a venue that only held 300 people).&nbsp; There were a few thousand people there and it was really great to see how big the band has gotten.</p><p><em>Me and my baby at the Race Track before the concert<br></em><img src="/images/IMG_5495_small_.jpg" alt="Me and my baby"  border="0" /></p><p><em>My 2 favorite girls…<br></em><img src="/images/IMG_5490_small_.jpg" alt="IMG_5490"  border="0" /></p><p><em>Rocking out before the concert…<br></em><img src="/images/IMG_5509_small_.jpg" alt="IMG_5509"  border="0" /></p><p><em>Goofing around…<br><img src="/images/IMG_5512_small_.jpg" alt="IMG_5512"  border="0" /></em></p><p><em>No, I’m not stoned in this picture…<br><img src="/images/IMG_5551_small_.jpg" alt="My JP Boodhoo Pose"  border="0" /></em></p><p><em>We’re Hungry…<br><img src="/images/IMG_5554_small_.jpg" alt="IMG_5554"  border="0" /></em></p><p><em>Finally, they arrive…<br><img src="/images/IMG_5570_small_.jpg" alt="IMG_5570"  border="0" /></em></p><p>They played mostly songs from their new album, Foiled (which is my least favorite to be honest).&nbsp; I much prefer The Answers or Consent to Treatment.</p><p><em><img src="/images/IMG_5603_small_.jpg" alt="IMG_5603"  border="0" /></em></p><p><em></em>&nbsp;</p><p>Blue October always puts on such a great show.&nbsp; The band is full of energy and Justin’s vocals seem to never end.&nbsp; I don’t know how he does it… I was singing along all night and nearly lost my voice.&nbsp; I guess I can let go of my hopes of being a rock god <img src="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/smile1.gif">.&nbsp; Well, there’s always Guitar Hero.</p>
