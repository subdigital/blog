<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Installing MCMS 2002 SP1a on my laptop proved quite difficult this week.&nbsp; This is one product that Microsoft really did not focus on the install experience.</span></font></p><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"></span></font></p><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">I first tried to install it without Visual Studio 2003.&nbsp; It complained, so I got Visual Studio Installed.&nbsp; It also asked for the IE Web Controls, so I downloaded those, extracted it, and ran the build.bat file.&nbsp; I copied the sample app as directed and everything was working there.</span></font></p><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"></span></font></p><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">I didn&rsquo;t have SQL Server installed locally, so I didn&rsquo;t have SQL-DMO, but the installer didn&rsquo;t tell me how to get it.&nbsp; It kept complaining that I didn&rsquo;t have Visual Studio 2002, Visual Studio 2003, IE Web Controls, and SQL-DMO, when I clearly had 2 of those 4.</span></font></p><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"></span></font></p><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">I installed the SQL Client tools and that solved the SQL-DMO requirement.&nbsp; Then I found an MSI installer for IE Web Controls, and that did the trick there (apparently it doesn&rsquo;t REALLY check to see if you have it, it just checks the Add/Remove Programs section).&nbsp; Visual Studio 2002 isn&rsquo;t really required, the wording is just off on the installer.</span></font></p><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"></span></font></p><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">That was a waste of a day.&nbsp; I could have gotten much more accomplished if this installation had been easier.</span></font></p>
