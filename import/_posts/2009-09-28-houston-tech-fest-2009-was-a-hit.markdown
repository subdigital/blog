<p>I found that the content at <a href="http://houstontechfest.com" target="_blank">Houston Tech Fest</a> was stellar.&#160; What a range!&#160; We had people from all camps together in one place to learn &amp; share about technology.</p>  <p>I had 2 sessions (which unfortunately conflicted with a few other talks I wanted to go see!).</p>  <h4><strong>Beginning iPhone Development</strong></h4>  <p>I spent a bit too long talking about Objective-C and didn’t get enough time to code.&#160; I remember thinking that 75 minutes was a long time, but it was over before I knew it!</p>  <p>This talk had a lot of people in the room, and they all seemed genuinely engaged in the content.&#160; Some were frightened by Objective-C (understandably so) but hopefully I swayed their fears just a tad.&#160; iPhone development is fun!</p>  <p>Download the slide deck / code <a href="https://flux88.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Intro%20to%20iPhone%20Development.zip" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>  <p><em>(credit for the snowflake animation app:&#160; </em><a title="http://appsamuck.com/day9.html" href="http://appsamuck.com/day9.html"><em>http://appsamuck.com/day9.html</em></a><em> )</em></p>  <h4><strong>Build Automation &amp; Continuous Integration</strong></h4>  <p>This was a much smaller crowd, which was good I think… since it allowed us to have more of a conversation.&#160; I have to admit I was feeling pretty horrible during this talk, and I hope it didn’t show too much.&#160; I ended up leaving the event right after and went home and crashed!&#160; Anyway we covered NAnt, Rake, Phantom, and Psake… talk a bit about Database Migration tools, and finally touched on Continous integration with Team City.&#160; I again ran out of time, but I think there was good value in the build runner detail.</p>  <p>Download the slide deck / examples for this talk <a href="https://flux88.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Build%20Automation.zip" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
