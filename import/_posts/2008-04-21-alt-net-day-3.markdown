<p>Day 3 started out with some breakfast at the DigiPen campus.&nbsp; The first session was on Lean Software Development.&nbsp; Evan Hoff was supposed to convene this session, however he had to leave for the airport.&nbsp; Dave Laribee filled in.</p><p><strong>Lean Software Development</strong></p><p><img src="/images/IMG_0262_small_.jpg" alt="IMG_0262"  border="0"  /></p><p>Notes:</p><ul><li>Lean really refers to lean manufacturing</li><ul><li>manufacturing is a much more appropriate metaphor to software development</li><li>focus not just on software development, but on entire value stream from inception to delivery</li><li>Everything is a pull.</li><ul><li>i pull requirements off of a &ldquo;shelf&rdquo; someone should put the next one up there for me to grab it.&nbsp; If there isn&rsquo;t one there when I go to pull, waste occurrs, because I am waiting on something that I need.&nbsp; </li><li>This concept goes all the way down the chain</li><li>everything is a customer/supplier relationship</li></ul><li>Goal of any business is to make $</li><li>focus on flow (value stream)</li><li>I need to read these books:</li><ul><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Goal-Process-Ongoing-Improvement/dp/0884271781/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1208834345&amp;sr=1-2" target="_blank">The Goal</a></li><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Toyota-Way-Jeffrey-Liker/dp/0071392319/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1208834307&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">The Toyota Way</a></li><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lean-Thinking-Banish-Create-Corporation/dp/0684810352" target="_blank">Lean Thinking</a></li><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Lean-Accounting-Measuring-Enterpise/dp/1563272431/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1208834364&amp;sr=1-2" target="_blank">Lean Accounting</a></li><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Implementing-Lean-Software-Development-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321437381" target="_blank">Implementing Lean</a></li></ul><li>I think a good metaphor for this is&nbsp;to picture a rope that goes from the beginning of business actions (ie: a CEO makes a decision to create value for the business) to the end (business value).&nbsp; A number of interactions take place along the rope, and anytime you are pulling what you need from your &ldquo;supplier&rdquo; you have to have the slack, otherwise the rope will go taut.</li><ul><li>eliminating waste would mean to minimize the tension *and* the slack in the rope.</li></ul></ul></ul><p>I found a lot of value in this session because it seemed to pinpoint some of the issues that I face in my current project (ie: not technical problems, but getting customer involvement, prioritization of features based on business value, rather than tasks in TFS, etc).</p><p>I hope I didn&rsquo;t steal the stage at this session, but I felt like Lean is probably going to be an area of study of mine later this year (once I dwindle down my book list!).</p><p><strong>Advanced Techniques &amp; The rest of the team</strong></p><p>Some controversy surrounds development techniques such as IOC, SRP, ORM, AOP, etc.&nbsp; These are all complex topics that solve complex problems.&nbsp; For a team to not know how to deal with this, it can be fatal to a project.</p><p>Oren said that he tried to &ldquo;hide&rdquo; all of this from his team, so they woulnd&rsquo;t have to learn it.&nbsp; What happened?&nbsp; A year later (this week) he received a call and someone asked him what &ldquo;that windsor file was.&rdquo;&nbsp; I think it was obvious that this technique has a high &ldquo;bus&rdquo; factor.&nbsp; (I.E. what would happen if you got hit by a bus?)</p><p>Scott Bellware noticed that we kept saying &ldquo;Us&rdquo;&nbsp;and &ldquo;Them&rdquo; &mdash; which leads to distrust and lack of empathy.&nbsp; No really solid answers came out of this session, but a lot of folks concurred that an incremental approach to using very advanced techniques is ideal.</p><p>Oren recommended Release It! for the 100th time.&nbsp; I think I need to buy that book <img src="/images/smile1___________________________________.gif"   />&nbsp;(but I already mentioned my reading backlog).</p><p>&ldquo;Find the friction points and remove them&rdquo; &mdash; Oren said this referring to abstracting away the infrastructure in an application.</p><p><strong>Round table &amp; lunch at Thai Ginger</strong></p><p>The sessions came to a close and we all gathered in the main room again to do the final round table discussion of what we liked.&nbsp; We passed around a stick and said what we liked about the conference.&nbsp; <em>The stick was much nicer than the sweaty putty we had last time</em>.&nbsp; It was a little sad to have the event come to a close, but as they say &ldquo;When it&rsquo;s over it&rsquo;s over&rdquo;</p><p><img src="/images/endofday1_.jpg" alt="Endofday1"  border="0"  /></p><p>We met Donald Belcham and some of the rest of the Canadian Contingency (TM) for lunch at Thai Ginger.&nbsp; The waitstaff was friendly and the food was excellent.&nbsp; We even had a surprise visiter!&nbsp; Hey, how&rsquo;d you get there?</p><p><img src="/images/lunch_2Dendofday_.jpg" alt="Lunch-endofday"  border="0"  /></p><p><strong>Ending Thoughts</strong></p><p>This 2<sup>nd</sup> ALT.NET Conference was so much more profound than the first.&nbsp; There were no sessions on &ldquo;Are we hurting feelings&rdquo; or &ldquo;Can we change the name?&rdquo; and more topics like &ldquo;Git&rdquo; and &ldquo;F#&rdquo; and &ldquo;Coaching Agile Teams.&rdquo;&nbsp; Doc was right when he said that in Austin we were very much a &ldquo;storming&rdquo; team.&nbsp; This time around we were definitely &ldquo;norming&rdquo; and likely &ldquo;performing.&rdquo;&nbsp; I think the next ALT.NET in&nbsp;Austin (dubbed &ldquo;Continuous Improvement&rdquo;) will be even better.</p><p>Bye ALT.NET Seattle!&nbsp; See you in Austin this October!</p><div class="bjtags">Tags:<a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/altdotnet">altdotnet</a></div>
