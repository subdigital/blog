<p></p><p>Venkat Subramanium is an amazing speaker.&nbsp; I was fortunate enough to have him as my professor in college and what I remember most are the interesting analogies that helped explain tough topics.</p><p>His latest post, <a href="http://www.agiledeveloper.com/blog/" target="_blank">Walking along the developer beach</a>, is another gem that explains the rhythm that you must get in to gain the most productivity out of test-driven development (and test-2nd development).&nbsp; The most interesting thing is that it works for either school.&nbsp; Either you write the test first, then the method, or you write the method first, but immediately after you write your test.&nbsp; It forces you to hold the caller&rsquo;s perspective and not get buried in the code.&nbsp; A byproduct is cleaner, more testable code.</p><p>If you are writing unit tests, then that&rsquo;s a huge step that most people aren&rsquo;t even achieving yet, but to get the most out of them, write them in parallel with your methods.&nbsp; Otherwise you&rsquo;ll be hopping along one foot, just like hopskotch.</p><p><strong>Now playing:</strong> Breaking Benjamin - Wish I May</p>
