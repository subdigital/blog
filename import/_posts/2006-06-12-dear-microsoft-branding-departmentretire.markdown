<p>Let me be the first (well more like the 50,000th) to say that <a title="Microsoft renames WinFX to .NET 3.0" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2006/06/09/624300.aspx" target="_blank">re-branding WinFX to .NET Framework 3.0</a> is a <strong>STUPID</strong> idea.&nbsp; (Yeah that&rsquo;s right, I bolded it.)</p><p>Set aside for a second that it&rsquo;s a bad representation of the product, there&rsquo;s already a .NET Framework 3.0 in the works and <em>WinFX isn&rsquo;t it!</em>&nbsp; WinFX runs under CLR 2.0.&nbsp; They should call it .NET Framework 2.5 or something.&nbsp; WinFX will not include 3.0 features, such as LINQ.</p><p>Why, oh why, Microsoft?</p><p>WinFX was a cool name, and developers who were confused about the role of .NET in WinFX should just google it and read a tad.&nbsp; It won&rsquo;t kill you I promise.</p><p><em>/mourns the loss of Indigo, Avalon, and now WinFX in this Microsoft naming wtf&rsquo;ery</em></p><p><strong>Now playing:</strong> <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZSearch.woa/wa/advancedSearchResults?artistTerm=Keane">Keane</a> - <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZSearch.woa/wa/advancedSearchResults?songTerm=Untitled 1&amp;artistTerm=Keane">Untitled 1</a></p>
