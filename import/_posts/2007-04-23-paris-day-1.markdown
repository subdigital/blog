<p>My company, <a href="http://www.us.sogeti.com/" target="_blank">Sogeti</a>, has sent me to the beautiful county of France to attend a global enterprise SOA training from some of the folks at IBM.</p><p>So far, France is absolutely gorgeous.&nbsp; I braved the subway system with my friend <a href="http://blogs.sarkhouston.com/amurrell" target="_blank">Aaron Murrell</a>, which was very humorous.&nbsp; We got a bit turned around a few times, but we eventually found our stop.</p><p><img src="/images/IMG_3191_small3_.jpg" alt="Streets of Paris"  border="0"  /></p><p><img src="/images/IMG_3243_small_.jpg" alt="old building"  border="0"  /></p><p>We noticed that people park crazy in Paris&hellip;</p><p><img src="/images/IMG_3199_small_.jpg" alt="Smart car parking job"  border="0"  /></p><p>We went into Paris and tried to find a restaurant called Chartier, however we couldn&rsquo;t locate the street.&nbsp; A quaint restarant called Le Flash caught our eye and we walked in.&nbsp; The owner greeted us with many french words (which I do not understand) and we had a fun time ordering our food and communicating with him.&nbsp; The food was excellent, the beer was even better, and the owner even played Alan Jackson for us, ha!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t care for country music, but it was funny and appreciated nonetheless.</p><p><img src="/images/IMG_3201_small_.jpg" alt="Le Flash"  border="0"  /></p><p>We then took a taxi north to the city of Gouvieux where the corporate chateau resides.&nbsp; It really is breath-taking.&nbsp; It was built by Eiffel a long time ago, and is now home for our Capgemini University (well, the bar and dining area, that is).</p><p><img src="/images/IMG_3290_small_.jpg" alt="Le Chateau"  border="0"  /></p><p>We start our training tomorrow and I&rsquo;m sure our day will be full of introductions and hands-on training.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><div class="bjtags">Tags:<a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/paris">paris</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/travel">travel</a></div>
