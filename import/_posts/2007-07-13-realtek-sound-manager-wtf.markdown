<p>My current work computer has one of those crappy OEM Realtek Sound Manager craplet pieces of software.</p><p>I really hate it when hardware companies (especially sound card manufacturers) think that they should abandon the well-known and incredibly standard windows framed interface and invent their own scary window interface.</p><p>Anyway, I normally would never open this app, but it forces itself in focus when I plug in my headphones.&nbsp; (Yes, you read that correctly)</p><p><img src="/images/realtek_.jpg" hspace="5"  border="0"  /></p><p>Umm, WTF?&nbsp; It obviously <em>knows </em>what I plugged in because it is highlighted and checked.&nbsp; The headphones don&rsquo;t work until I click OK on this box.</p><p>The worst part?&nbsp; Uninstalling the application renders the sound card useless.&nbsp; Pfft.</p>
