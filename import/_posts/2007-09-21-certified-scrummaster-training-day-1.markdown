<p>So my buddy Jimmy and I are in Austin right now taking a Certified ScrumMaster course by Mark Pushinksy.&nbsp; </p><p>I&rsquo;m ecstatic to be earning this certification, and while I won&rsquo;t be getting a &ldquo;Get out of my way, I&rsquo;m a ScrumMaster&rdquo; T-Shirt, I am getting incredibly valuable, practical Scrum training from two experts.</p><p>Excellent Quotes from today:</p><blockquote><p>Mark (trainer):&nbsp; So what do you see in the Waterfall model that you don&rsquo;t see in the agile model?<br />Guy: You mean &ldquo;Water<strong>fail</strong>&rdquo; ??</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mark (acting as a troubled PM who hasn&rsquo;t seen any results in 7 months):&nbsp; Well, I need ALL of those features.&nbsp; They are all important.<br />Jeff Palermo:&nbsp; What if I told you that your budget was reduced to 1/10th of what it is now.&nbsp; What would be&nbsp; most important then?<br />Mark:&nbsp; Umm, well all that is important.&nbsp; I need it ALL.<br />Jeff Palermo:&nbsp; Ok, so if I could give you <em>something </em>in 30 days, what would you like to see first?<br />Mark:&nbsp; You can give me something in 30 days?!?!?!</p><p><em>This dialog was very valuable to me.</em></p><p>Mark:&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t heal, what you can&rsquo;t feel.&nbsp; (not going to sell agile if they aren&rsquo;t already feeling pain with current process)</p><p><br />&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Here are some notable points:</p><ul><li>If you tell a customer that it&rsquo;s going to take 12&ndash;18 months to deliver his software, what kind of features do you think he&rsquo;s going to ask for?&nbsp; He&rsquo;s going to think &ldquo;Well if I&rsquo;m not going to get it for over a year, I better get the everything and the kitchen sink!&rdquo;&nbsp; Contrast this with telling the customer that you can deliver in 30 days, what is most important?</li><li>Scrum demands transparency on the project.&nbsp; Why would some people resist this?&nbsp; Lack of trust, Fear of failure (or appearing as a failure).</li><li>Shu, Ha, Ri (martial arts terms &mdash; Learning the Rules, Applying the Rules, Adapting and Combining the Rules)</li><li>Waterfall separation of analyst, architects, developers, testers breeds lack of trust.&nbsp; In the extremem these groups become &ldquo;enemies&rdquo; &mdash; Ever heard &ldquo; Oh if we ever got good requirements we could deliver&rdquo;&nbsp; &mdash; or &ldquo;the developers are delivering tons of bugs to us!&nbsp; What are they doing?!?!&rdquo;</li><li>Agile/Iterative teams self-organize and fill needed roles to meet the sprint goal&nbsp;&ndash; this <em>fosters </em>trust between team members</li><li>The class had some trinkets and creativity toys which I thought was a nice touch to break the monotony of sitting in the same place for a long time</li><li>There were many hands on activities, many requiring us to stand up.&nbsp; These were awesome!</li><li>Think of scrum as a snowman.&nbsp; The head is the daily activity (24 hrs), the middle section is the sprint (2&ndash;4 weeks) and the base is the release plan (3&ndash;6 months)</li><li>Don&rsquo;t make squirrel burgers (don&rsquo;t deliver software that is low quality.&nbsp; Low quality means sloppy code, no unit tests, any corner-cutting.)</li></ul><p>Role of Scrum Master</p><ul><li>Remove barriers</li><li>Increase transparency</li><li>Help Customer/Product Owner realize ROI by prioritizing product backlog</li><li>Educating those involved about scrum rules</li><li>(Silent) leader / facilitator</li><li>Improving engineering practices to meeting shippable goal at end of sprint</li><li>empower team to&nbsp;make decisions and get stuff done (self organize)</li><li>look for &ldquo;coachable moments&rdquo;</li></ul><p>More to come tomorrow&hellip;</p><div class="bjtags">Tags:<a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/Scrum">Scrum</a></div>
