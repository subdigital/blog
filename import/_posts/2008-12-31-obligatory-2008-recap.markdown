<p>What kind of blogger would I be if I didn't do a recap of the year?&nbsp; <em>Well I guess since I've never done this before, not a very good one.</em>&nbsp; 2008 was a phenomenal year.</p> <h2></h2> <h2>Me</h2> <p>I started out the year doing my <a href="http://flux88.com/blog/asp-net-mvc-tour-of-texas/">ASP.NET MVC Tour of Texas</a>, where I visited San Antonio, Austin, Fort Worth, and Houston talking about ASP.NET MVC.&nbsp; It must have gotten some notice, because shortly after I was invited to be a co-author for <a href="http://manning.com/palermo" target="_blank">ASP.NET MVC in Action</a>.&nbsp; The book is getting close to being completed, so expect to see it on store shelves in the coming months.</p> <p>In April, I attended the 2nd ALT.NET gathering, which inspirational and eye-opening (<a href="http://flux88.com/blog/alt-net-day-1/">Day1</a>, <a href="http://flux88.com/blog/alt-net-day-2/">Day2</a>, <a href="http://flux88.com/blog/alt-net-day-2-continued/">Day2.2</a>, <a href="http://flux88.com/blog/alt-net-day-3/">Day3</a>).</p> <p>In May <a href="http://flux88.com/blog/i-m-an-insider/">I became an ASP Insider</a>.&nbsp; This has been the very best way to give my feedback to Microsoft about upcoming releases.&nbsp; Also in May I started holding semi-regular <a href="http://flux88.com/blog/houston-alt-net-geek-dinner-next-tuesday/">Houston ALT.NET Geek Dinners</a>.</p> <p>In September, the nasty hurricane Ike rolled through Houston, luckily <a href="http://flux88.com/blog/ike-is-gone-we-re-okay/">we made it through with little damage</a>.&nbsp; Others were not as fortunate.</p> <p>In October <a href="http://flux88.com/blog/recent-developments/">I was given the Microsoft MVP Award for ASP.NET</a>.&nbsp; I'm looking forward to going to the summit next March &amp; meeting other MVPs from around the world.</p> <p>I attended <a href="http://kaizenconf.com/" target="_blank">KaizenConf</a> in November, which was really great.&nbsp; Every time I go to one of these conferences I feel energized to go out and do good in the world.&nbsp; It sounds cheesy, but it's really great.&nbsp; I hope that others find their way out of the mainstream marketing jungle of conferences and attend one of these open spaces.</p> <p>In December, my wife and I found out that <a href="http://flux88.com/blog/hello-world-x-2/">we are having twins</a>!&nbsp; For those counting, we'll now have a full basketball team :).&nbsp; Needless to say 2009 will be a busy year.</p> <h2>The blog</h2> <p>This blog has gone under some transition too.&nbsp; Originally I was using <a href="http://dasblog.info" target="_blank">dasBlog</a> hosted at <a href="http://webhost4life.com" target="_blank">WebHost4Life</a> and things worked pretty well.&nbsp; I wanted to have some more control over what I could do with my server, so I ordered a VPS plan with VPS Land.&nbsp; That turned out to be a big mistake.&nbsp; </p> <p>I quickly moved over to a VPS over at <a href="http://godaddy.com" target="_blank">GoDaddy</a> which worked out okay for most of the year.&nbsp; It turns out their domain service is better than their hosting service.&nbsp; My blog kept making it run out of memory, so I moved my blog over to <a href="http://www.orcsweb.com" target="_blank">Orcsweb</a>.&nbsp; I also ported the content over to Graffiti, and so far it has been smooth sailing ever since.&nbsp; I still host my <a href="http://silvia.flux88.com" target="_blank">wife's</a> and <a href="http://heather.flux88.com" target="_blank">sister's</a> blogs on GoDaddy, as well as my <a href="http://www.cripplecreekwoodworks.com" target="_blank">uncle's furniture business</a>.</p> <h2>What's in store for 2009?</h2> <p>I have a few goals for 2009 that I'd like to publicly share, if for no other reason than to really commit to it.&nbsp; I'd like to wrap up the book.&nbsp; It is time consuming like you wouldn't believe, and I'll be glad when it's over.&nbsp; </p> <p>I'd also like to read more.&nbsp; It seems that I only read 6 or 7 books in 2008, and that's pathetic.&nbsp; At the rate that my book list is growing, I'll never read all that I want.&nbsp; So far 99% of the books on my list are about software development, and I'd like to change that.&nbsp; I'm starting to get interested in other things, like GTD, organization, fiction...&nbsp; I need to broaden my horizons.</p> <p>I'd like to do another long series of posts, similar to my <a href="http://flux88.com/blog/a-journey-with-nhibernate-part-1/" target="_blank">Journey with NHibernate</a> series.&nbsp; It still remains my all time most popular set of posts, and now the material is a little dated.&nbsp; I've learned a lot since then.&nbsp; I'm definitely open to ideas.</p> <p>I'm also going to get back into guitar.&nbsp; In 2008 I really didn't play more than once a month, and it shows.&nbsp; My fingers are soft, I've forgotten how to play many songs, and I've definitely lost my technique for fingering.&nbsp; It's all chords now.&nbsp; I'm looking at purchasing a new electric guitar to help give me the nudge.</p> <p>Lastly, I would like to do another speaking tour, only this time I'm not sure what topic.&nbsp; It was a ton of fun, and maybe this time I can get a sponsor to help me visit more cities.</p> <p>So long 2008, you were great.</p>
