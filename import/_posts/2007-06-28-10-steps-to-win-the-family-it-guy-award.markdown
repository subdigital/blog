<p>I&rsquo;m sure that most of my readers are the &ldquo;Family IT&rdquo; people&nbsp;to their relatives.&nbsp; You know, the kind of person that gets regular phone calls from parents, aunts, uncles, cousins, brothers, sisters, grandparents, kids, etc.</p><p>I have filled that role since I was probably 13.&nbsp; Most of the time I would just get annoyed, but now, in my infinite maturity (<img src="/images/smile1_______________________.gif"   />), I have fully accepted this responsibility.&nbsp; Here are the 10 steps you (and I) should take to win the <strong>Family IT Guy</strong> award&hellip;&nbsp; come on, you know you want it!</p><div style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><p><img src="/images/family_it_guy.gif" alt="Family_it_guy"  border="0"  /></p></div><p><strong>Step 1:&nbsp; Get a Good Backup Strategy</strong></p><p>It starts with a backup strategy.&nbsp; I have a 500GB Western Digital My Book that takes images of my home PCs and stores them.&nbsp; This pretty much works, except when my house burns down I have nothing.&nbsp; My wife has about 45 GB worth of family photos and digital scrapbooking material.&nbsp; It would be catastrophic to lose all that stuff.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s irreplaceable.&nbsp; Other data that is important to backup are digital scans of driver&rsquo;s licenses, social security cards, birth certificates, tax forms, etc.</p><p>So I setup both of our computers (mine and my wife&rsquo;s) on Carbonite online backup.&nbsp; Carbonite installs a little background process that will backup your files behind the scenes.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s less than $50/year and you can store <strong>unlimited</strong> data.&nbsp; Your data is encrypted and uploaded and you can pull it down at any time.</p><p>It also installs a little explorer overlay icon that shows you a blue, green, or yellow dot.&nbsp; Green means backed up, so your family knows they&rsquo;re safe.</p><p><strong>Step 2:&nbsp; Keep Spare Parts Around</strong></p><p>I can&rsquo;t begin to count how many times a family member has asked me for a network cable, or a sound card, or a network card, or just about any other piece of hardware that a computer needs.&nbsp; Since I do a lot of&nbsp;tinkering with computer hardware, I tend to have a lot of spare parts.</p><p>Your uncle will appreciate not having to order a new sound card for $15 at the local computer shop or (gasp!) online at&nbsp;<a href="http://newegg.com/" target="_blank">newegg</a>.</p><p><strong>Step 3:&nbsp; Keep a Digital Toolbelt on you &ndash; A 2GB USB&nbsp;Drive</strong></p><p>I have a copy of&nbsp;every tool from <a href="http://sysinternals.com/" target="_blank">SysInternals</a> on my&nbsp;USB&nbsp;Key.&nbsp;They are invaluable when digging deep into Windows problems.</p><p>I also put <a href="http://portableapps.com/" target="_blank">portable apps</a> such as <a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable" target="_blank">Firefox Portable</a> my thumb drive.&nbsp; This allows me to run a better browser when nothing but IE 6 is installed.</p><p>Also grab a copy of <a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/utilities/clamwin_portable" target="_blank">ClamWin Antivirus Portable</a><font color="#0066cc"> </font>(or <a href="http://www.clamwin.com/" target="_blank">regular version</a>)&nbsp;or another free AV program.&nbsp; You never know when you&rsquo;ll have a cousin jump out of the bushes and ask you to clean their laptop.</p><p>Keeping a thumb drive on you will make it a lot easier to use a family member&rsquo;s computer.&nbsp; The last thing you want to do is <em>have to come back later</em> with the right tools!</p><p><em>For a good list of essential tools, check out <a href="http://computerzen.com/tools" target="_blank">Scott Hanselman&rsquo;s Ultimate Tools List</a>.</em></p><p><strong>Step 4:&nbsp; Setup Family Email</strong></p><p>We&rsquo;re all tired of email addresses like <a href="mailto:JRod44222354@aol.com">JRod44222354@aol.com</a>. (Apologies if that is your email address.)&nbsp; I recently setup <strong>scheirman.com</strong> as my family domain name and gave most of my relatives their own email address.&nbsp; Most of them were pretty excited to have a <a href="mailto:firstname@lastname.com">firstname@lastname.com</a> email address.&nbsp; Of course if your last name is Smith, then you&rsquo;ll have to get creative.</p><p>To host the email I&rsquo;m using Google Apps for Your Domain and it works like a charm.&nbsp; Not only do you get all the goodness of GMail, but you get a personal email address as well!&nbsp; Their interface is slick and easy to use.</p><p><strong>Step 5:&nbsp; Advise on New Computer Purchases</strong></p><p>Don&rsquo;t let your Grandmother buy that new computer from the neigbor kid down the street.&nbsp; If you see your cousin walk into the Sony Style store at the mall with an armload of cash, <strong>stop her</strong>.&nbsp; </p><p>Computers are cheap.&nbsp; Unless you want a high-end gaming rig or a video processing machine, your standard Dell fare will do you just fine, and often times under $600.&nbsp; It comes with a warranty, which saves you a headache for at least a year <img src="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/smile1.gif" />.</p><p><strong>Step 6:&nbsp; Get a Remote Access Plan</strong></p><p>When your sister calls you from Montana and says she needs help adding a user to her computer, be ready.&nbsp; With some good remote access software it can be painless to just take control and do it for her.</p><p><a href="http://copilot.com/" target="_blank">FogCreek Copilot</a> is supposed to be good.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/" target="_blank">Joel Spolsky</a><font color="#0066cc">&rsquo;s</font> company <a href="http://www.fogcreeksoftware.com/" target="_blank">Fog Creek Software</a> wrote it and I have heard good reviews.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very cheap for about an hour of use and <em>&ldquo;it just works.&rdquo;</em></p><p><img src="/images/crossloop_screenshot_small.jpg" alt="Crossloop_screenshot_small"  border="0"  /></p><p>CrossLoop is a tool I just tried out the other day, and it also &ldquo;just works.&rdquo;&nbsp; You and your relative can download this in less than a minute, run it, and be connected even behind firewalls.&nbsp; Best of all, it&rsquo;s free!</p><p>I used this the other day when I was helping my wife upload some files to her blog with an FTP client.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t have much time and it was a bit difficult to explain over the phone, so I told her to download the client, click &ldquo;Host&rdquo;&nbsp;and then read me the number on the screen.&nbsp; </p><p>That&rsquo;s all it took!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 7:&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t Get Annoyed</strong></p><p>PC Enthusiasts frequently whine and moan about having to help their relatives about how to use the computer.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s easy for us because we use it everyday.&nbsp; Many non-techies perceive computer gurus like they do auto mechanics or lawyers.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t want this kind of image!</p><p>The next time you walk up to your computer, take a look at how many buttons there are.&nbsp; What if your Grandmother sat down for the first time to use a PC?&nbsp; It is incredibly intimidating and complicated.&nbsp; How did <em>you</em> react when you first got a virus?&nbsp; </p><p>Cut your family some slack.&nbsp; <strong>Be Patient</strong>.</p><p><strong>Step 8:&nbsp; Spread the word.&nbsp; </strong></p><p>Get your peeps using Firefox instead of Internet Explorer.&nbsp; Tell them the wonders of GMail.&nbsp; Explain to them that there&rsquo;s more than the MSN home page.&nbsp; Getting the word out is the only way you can ever expect people to <em>see the light</em>.</p><p>When someone forwards you an email with a taseless joke or a reason why you should thank the heavens for waking up in the morning, only in ALL CAPS&hellip; politely inform them of internet etiquette.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t just push the SPAM button.</p><p>I bought my dad a copy of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lifehacker-Tech-Tricks-Turbocharge-Your/dp/0470050659" target="_blank">Lifehacker book</a> for Christmas last year.&nbsp; He lov
ed it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s full of useful tools and tricks to make your computer work for you.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a computer guy, mind you&hellip; but not the typical person who would read <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/">www.lifehacker.com</a> on a daily basis (though now he proabably does).</p><p><strong>Step 9:&nbsp; Find a Protog√©</strong></p><p>You can&rsquo;t do this stuff forever.&nbsp; Look at the younger folks in your family that can help take the throne.&nbsp; Tell them, &ldquo;One day&hellip;.&nbsp; this will all be yours&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Be a mentor about good computer usage and troubleshooting.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be stingy with The Badge.&nbsp; Pass it on.</p><p><strong>Step 10:&nbsp; Let Your Family Know Your Other Interests</strong></p><p>I enjoy playing guitar, swimming, grilling food with family, playing board games, reading books, watching movies and addicting TV shows.&nbsp; If all you talk about is World of Warcraft, <strong>people are going to think you are weird</strong>.&nbsp; Let your family know that you are at least a tad normal, and that you do enjoy sunlight once in a while.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So there you have it, there are my 10 steps to becoming a good Family IT Guy.&nbsp; A lot of my Family IT Guy inspiration comes from <a href="http://computerzen.com/" target="_blank">Scott Hanselman</a>, who seems to have all this down pretty darn good.&nbsp; I hope his family knows how good they have it.</p><div class="bjtags">Tags:<a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/IT">IT</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/Support">Support</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/Family">Family</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/Backup">Backup</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/Remote">Remote</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/Tools">Tools</a></div>
