<p>I&rsquo;m in the airport now awaiting my flight home.&nbsp; The code camp was a blast!&nbsp; I was very glad to meet a bunch of very smart folks and pick their brains.&nbsp; I also miss my family, so I&rsquo;m glad to be going home.</p><p>Being surrounded by like-minded people really validates that the things that we are doing are of value, and I really think that the industry is poised for a change as a whole.&nbsp; At the code camp there was an Agile Experts Panel (which I was a part of somehow <img src="/images/smile1_______________________________.gif"   />&nbsp;)&nbsp; &mdash; anyway, there was only one guy up there that was questioning the things that we were talking about.&nbsp; In my experience the agile ones are the outnumbered ones.&nbsp; There were a number of .NET newcomers who were just getting into development, and it was really good to recommend some solid books and blogs to get them started.</p><p>It was fun to listen to Scott Bellware not pull any punches and be incredibly blunt about what he believes about agile.&nbsp; </p><p>A couple of my favorite quotes of the day:</p><ul><li>&ldquo;God forbid we ask our developers to <strong>LEARN</strong>&hellip;&rdquo; &ndash; Scott Bellware</li><li>&ldquo;When you fire up the debugger to verify something and then click stop, the &lsquo;test&rsquo; that you just performed goes into the ether.&nbsp; Every time someone does that, God kills a kitten&hellip;&rdquo; &ndash; Dave Laribee</li></ul><p>I can&rsquo;t wait to get together with these guys again at the ALT.NET open spaces conference in October.</p><p>(oh &mdash; I&rsquo;m working on finishing the example from my presentation, so I&rsquo;ll post the files for that as soon as I finish)</p>
