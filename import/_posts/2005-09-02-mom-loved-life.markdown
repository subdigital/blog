<p>My mom died last Wednesday, due to advanced ovarian cancer. She was 53. It has been quite a sad household for the past week and a half, and I don't expect it to get better anytime soon. I will really miss her. </p><p>Her funeral was on Saturday and the service was beautiful. Many people were present and I knew most of them. </p><p>My mother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2001 and fought it for more than 3 years before deciding to choose quality of life over longevity. Cancer is an ugly thing. I'm glad she did get a lot of good moments and memories in the past year and a half that we've been taking care of her. </p><p>Anyway, consider making a small donation to the <a href="http://www.ocrf.org/site/c.kwK0JbNTJtF/b.574943/k.CBC0/Home.htm" target="_blank">Ovarian Cancer Research Fund</a>. </p><p>During this tragedy I didn't get out much, and had no idea about Hurricane Katrina until yesterday. The Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund is in need of cash donations, and I'm glad the Buzz stepped up. They are going to try and hit $500k by the end of the day. I really respect what they are doing.&nbsp; What a sad month it has been&hellip;</p>
