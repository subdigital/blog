<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/">http://www.microsoft.com/surface/</a><br><br>This is so cool I just had to blog about it.&nbsp; Take a minute to watch the videos, they are quite impressive.<br><br>Basically it's a 30 inch surface that is monitored by tiny wireless cameras.&nbsp; Hand gestures can rotate and resize images and videos and things.&nbsp; I don't think we're at a point where we can give up the keyboard or the mouse, but think of some of the other uses it would be good for.<br><br>In the videos they show a simple paint program that kids would enjoy.&nbsp; They also show it at a restaurant where the menu is all digital and you flip through it using your fingers.&nbsp; When you're ready to order, you just drag the item to the center.&nbsp; The same would go for paying the bill.&nbsp; Set your credit card on the table, split the checks up, calculate the tip, and charge the card all without waiting for a server to do it for you.<br><br>I think we're going to see some really cool uses for this thing outside of normal computing.<br><p></p>
