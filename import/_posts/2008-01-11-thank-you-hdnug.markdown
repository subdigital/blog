<p>I enjoyed giving the presentation on ASP.NET MVC tonight to about 90 eager developers at HDNUG here in Houston.</p><p>There were a few people that had played with the framework before, a lot who had heard of it, and about 1/3 of the room had never heard of it.&nbsp; Awesome!</p><p>There&rsquo;s always a balance between how intro a talk should be, but one of my goals with this talk is to show <em>real</em> application code; to show how you <em>actually</em> test these things, and what types of practices and tools that can enable this and make it easy.</p><p>I hope that the talk was well received.&nbsp; If you went, I&rsquo;d love to hear your feedback in the comments!</p><p>Some links from the talk:</p><ul><li><a href="http://castleproject.org/container" target="_blank">Castle Windsor</a></li><li><a href="http://castleproject.org/activerecord" target="_blank">Castle ActiveRecord</a></li><li><a href="http://www.ayende.com/projects/rhino-mocks/downloads.aspx" target="_blank">Rhino Mocks</a></li><li><a href="http://www.codeplex.com/MVCContrib" target="_blank">MVCContrib</a></li><li><a href="http://blog.wekeroad.com/2007/12/05/aspnet-mvc-preview-using-the-mvc-ui-helpers/" target="_blank">MVCToolkit</a> @ Rob Conery&rsquo;s blog</li><li><a href="http://haacked.com/" target="_blank">Phil Haack&rsquo;s blog</a></li><li><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu" target="_blank">Scott Guthrie&rsquo;s blog</a></li></ul><p>I&rsquo;m sending the code over to be posted at HDNUG right now.&nbsp; After my tour ends next week, I&rsquo;ll post a large recap that includes code and hopefully answers to common questions that I&rsquo;ve been hearing.</p><p>They also recorded the talk, so once I get my hands on the video, I&rsquo;ll throw it up here so others can have a look.</p><p>Thanks for having me HDNUG!</p>
