<p>I just wrapped up my session on Test-Driven Development with ASP.NET MVC.&nbsp; The audience was a bit thin, but the people who were there seemed genuinely interested in both ASP.NET MVC and Test Driven Development.</p> <p>I had a little hiccup during the demo, so I had to comment out my Windsor code &amp; just revert to poor man's dependency injection!&nbsp; What's weird is that this worked 20 minutes before the demo, but whatever.</p> <p>Another thing to note is that I'm now a BDD convert, so my tests changed a bit from the material that was delivered on DVD over a month ago.&nbsp; The example I did today, with BDD style tests &amp; some ShouldBe extension methods is available here:</p> <p><a href="http://benscheirman.googlecode.com/files/vslive%20las%20vegas%202008.zip" target="_blank">VS Live Presentation Material</a></p> <p>I also ended up winning a little bit of money yesterday, which was awesome!&nbsp; While playing nickel slots and talking on the phone to my wife, I accidentally pressed the cash out button when I only had $0.10 left :)&nbsp; Here's a stellar picture showing my excitement:</p> <p><a href="http://flux88.com/uploads/VSLiveTulsaTechFestMaterial_9BAA/lasvegaswinnings.png"><img src="/images/lasvegaswinnings_thumb_.png" alt="las-vegas-winnings"  border="0" /></a> </p> <h2>Tulsa TechFest</h2> <p>Also, last week I gave two presentations in Tulsa:</p> <ul> <li>Become a .NET Jedi with ReSharper</li> <li>Build a blog with ASP.NET MVC</li></ul> <p>The audiences for both talks were very engaged, and I think they both went really well.&nbsp; I did leave Tulsa wondering, however, <strong>what's with all the VB developers!</strong>&nbsp; (I kid, I kid!)</p> <p>The material for the blog example is available here:</p> <p><a href="http://benscheirman.googlecode.com/files/vslive%20las%20vegas%202008.zip" target="_blank">Tulsa TechFest Presentation Material</a></p> <p>If you want to browse the source for either of these talks, check out <a href="http://code.google.com/p/benscheirman" target="_blank">my google code repository</a> (they'll be posted soon).</p> <p>Thanks to those who attended my talks &amp; game me valuable feedback.&nbsp; I'm always looking to improve my presentation skills.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>What's next for me?&nbsp; I'll be speaking at the <a href="http://www.innotechok.com/" target="_blank">Innotech</a> in Oklahoma City on November 6th, on the same subject.</p>
