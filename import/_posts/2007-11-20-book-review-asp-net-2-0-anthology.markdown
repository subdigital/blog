A few weeks ago, <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com">Jeff Atwood</a> sent me a free review copy of his new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/ASP-NET-2-0-Anthology-Essential-Tricks/dp/098028581X">The ASP.NET 2.0 Anthology</a>.&nbsp; He co-authored the book with <a href="http://odetocode.com/blogs/scott/default.aspx">K. Scott Allen</a> (from <a href="http://odetocode.com/">OdeToCode</a>), <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/articlelist/452">Wyatt Barnett</a>, <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/">Jon Galloway</a>, and <a href="http://haacked.com">Phil Haack</a>.<br><br>Normally I wouldn't get excited about a book like this, but looking at that list of authors I was more than intrigued to give it a try.&nbsp; Granted, the book is targeted for the beginner to intermediate ASP.NET developer, so a lot of it was not very helpful to me, but I did find quite a few good nuggets that I will take away and utilize in the future.<br><br>The first few chapters give a general overview of the newer features of .NET 2.0 and some other basic concepts.&nbsp; I think that this would be helpful to someone just coming to ASP.NET (maybe from another language) and want to get started.&nbsp; <br><br>The book was published by SitePoint, under their "Anthology" style.&nbsp; This means the book is organized into 101 different "tips" phrased as questions that someone might ask on a forum or similar.&nbsp; Some examples from Chapter 1 are "How do I use source control?" and "How do I go about using open source code?" -- I was pleased to see these sections in the book.&nbsp; You normally wouldn't expect this and I think it helped make the book more well-rounded.<br><br>The middle chapters were a bit more targeted to the intermediate ASP.NET level, which made it more interesting for me.&nbsp; They covered things like custom configuration sections, custom validation, how to maintain control state when viewstate is turned off.&nbsp; All throughout I think the authors gave solid advice on all these features.&nbsp; There was a good section on Membership and Access Control, which is sure to be helpful to intermediate ASP.NET developers.<br><br>The last few chapters were the most interesting to me, which is funny because most of them weren't specific to ASP.NET.&nbsp; A section on troubleshooting bothersome SQL queries is sure to help people out.&nbsp; There were a good number of general web developer tips, such as considering SEO and clean HTML for good search engine rankings.&nbsp; I appreciated the tip on how to utilize URL rewriting at the IIS level, and how to serve-up custom images to evil hotlinkers on myspace (thanks <strike>Jeff</strike> Jon!).&nbsp; These types of things are great to know when pursuing a career as a web developer.&nbsp; The last chapter introduced <a href="http://subsonicproject.com">SubSonic</a>, which I think was awesome.&nbsp; Not many developers that I meet have heard of SubSonic and I find it to be a pretty useful tool with a low barrier of entry.&nbsp; It definitely warranted some attention in this book.<br><br>While a lot of the content was your typical ASP.NET 2.0 fodder that I avoid (like SqlDataSource), I thought that the authors did a good job of noting when things were applicable, for example when to use the Web Site model vs. Web Application Projects.&nbsp; The book didn't have enough beginner content and explanation of ASP.NET to be a beginner book (which is a good thing), but it did have quite a lot of excellent tips that makes this book a great companion to any intermediate developer.<br><p></p>
