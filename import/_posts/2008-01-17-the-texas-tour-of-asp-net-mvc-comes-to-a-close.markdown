<p><font style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #f4f4f4">It&rsquo;s been an exciting two weeks.&nbsp; I visited user groups in San Antonio, Houston, Austin, and Fort Worth, and I got to meet and connect with a lot of interested developers about the new ASP.NET MVC framework.</font></p><p>Two of the events were recorded, so if I ever get my hands on the recorded bits, I&rsquo;ll post them here in an easily watchable format.&nbsp; (Don&rsquo;t hold your breath though.)</p><p>My presentation had a minimal amount of PowerPoint.&nbsp; I decided to focus on real code.&nbsp; <em>And people have thanked me for it!</em>&nbsp; </p><p>I covered:</p><ul><li>Basics of MVC</li><li>Default Routes</li><li>Simple Controller / Action</li><li>Passing data to the views</li><li>passing strongly typed view data</li><li>Custom Routes</li><li>new/edit form for an entity</li><li>writing tests for controllers</li><li>rhino mocks for mocking out dependencies</li><li>dependency injection for controllers (using Windsor)</li><li>ajax integration with prototype</li></ul><p>This is a lot to tackle in my 1/1.5 hour time slot.&nbsp; And I do get a lot of blank stares when I talk about mock objects and dependency injection, but I think more presentations need to present realistic code, rather than simple examples.&nbsp; The feedback I&rsquo;ve gotten about this has been overwhelmingly positive, and I&rsquo;m really glad people liked it.</p><p>Some questions that were asked during my tour&hellip;</p><p><em><strong>&ldquo;Ben, you are phenominally good-looking?&nbsp; Are you available?&rdquo;<br /></strong></em><em>&mdash;</em>umm no, I&rsquo;m married (and now terrified)</p><p><strong>&ldquo;<em>What is that cool zoomey tool you used?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s awesome!&rdquo;<br />&mdash;</em></strong>that is called <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897434.aspx" target="_blank">ZoomIt</a>, by sysinternals.</p><p>&ldquo;<em><strong>What are you using for data access on your entities?&rdquo;<br /></strong>&mdash;</em>It&rsquo;s called <a href="http://castleproject.org/" target="_blank">Castle ActiveRecord</a>, which uses <a href="http://www.nhibernate.org/" target="_blank">NHibernate</a> underneath.</p><p>&ldquo;<strong><em>Can I use ASP.NET validators?&rdquo;<br /></em></strong>&mdash;Well not really.&nbsp; The validators have viewstate, which won&rsquo;t work.&nbsp; Your validation definitely belongs in the Model, so you could just do server-side if you want.&nbsp; If you want clientside validation, you could accomplish a similar result by using marker css classes and some clever javascript&nbsp; (think &lt;input type=&rdquo;text&rdquo; class=&rdquo;required&rdquo; name=&rdquo;address1&rdquo; /&gt;&lt;span class=&rdquo;error_message&rdquo;&gt;This is required&lt;/span&gt;</p><p>&ldquo;<strong><em>If we use this on IIS6, will performance suffer?&rdquo;<br /></em></strong>&mdash; Probably.&nbsp; On IIS 5/6 you have to send all requests through ASP.NET, which can be slower.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not an expert in this area, so definitely do your research before making any rash decisions.&nbsp; When we have Windows Server 2008 and IIS7, expect vast improvements.</p><p>&ldquo;<strong><em>Do you know Justice Gray?&rdquo;<br /></em></strong>&mdash;Sure do.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a bona-fide potential friend of Justice Gray, and even have the certificate to prove it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s serial number marked 00000000000003.&nbsp; I carry it with me at all times for just such a question.</p><p>&ldquo;<strong><em>Can you use co-exist with webforms?&rdquo;<br /></em></strong>&mdash;Yes!&nbsp; If you hit a page with the .aspx extension, the PageHandlerFactory will pick it up and you will be in WebForms Land.&nbsp; If you instead hit a route, you&rsquo;ll be in MVC Land.&nbsp; Learn to know the difference and you&rsquo;ll be fine.</p><p>&ldquo;<strong><em>Isn&rsquo;t it dangerous to output strings directly like that?&rdquo;<br /></em></strong>&mdash;Yes it is.&nbsp; Read my <a href="http://www.flux88.com/BeCarefulOutputtingStringsInASPNETMVC.aspx" target="_blank">post about html encoding your values</a>.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;<em>Your hair is impeccable?&nbsp; What kind of gel do you use?&rdquo;<br /></em></strong>&mdash; It&rsquo;s called Fructis something-or-other&hellip; and it&rsquo;s awesome!</p><p>&ldquo;<strong><em>So Microsoft has two methods of developing web applications?&nbsp; Which should I choose?&rdquo;<br /></em></strong>&mdash;If you like the rich eventing model and the ability to save state and mimick a smart client ui, then choose web forms.&nbsp; If you value clean html, urls, separation of concerns, and testability, then choose MVC.&nbsp; I will be choosing MVC more often than not from here on out.</p><p>&ldquo;<strong><em>When will it be released&rdquo;<br /></em></strong>&mdash;Gawsh, I don&rsquo;t know?&nbsp; Fall 2008?&nbsp; As soon as I know I&rsquo;ll post it here.</p><p>(<em>admittedly, a couple of those questions were not asked &mdash; I&rsquo;ll let you guess which ones)</em></p><p>You can download the code and the presentation here:</p><p><a href="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/save_20the_20world_20with_20asp.net_20mvc.zip" target="_blank">File Attachment: save the world with asp.net mvc.zip (1612 KB)</a></p><p>I&rsquo;d like to thank the user group leaders for having me speak, it was certainly a pleasure.&nbsp; Where will the next tour be?</p>
