<p>And so Day 2 comes to a close.&nbsp; One of the biggest problems with this conference is that at any given time I will want to attend 2&ndash;3 simultaneous sessions.&nbsp; Fortunately, the open spaces format allows anyone at anytime to float (I think the term is&nbsp;&ldquo;be a butterfly&rdquo; or &ldquo;be a bumble bee&rdquo;).&nbsp; I did this in a few sessions to maximize the amount of sessions I could attend.</p><p>We started out at Ruby&rsquo;s Diner for breakfast.&nbsp; I arrived at the event to see people looking at the schedule wall.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s really amazing to watch a conference self-organize like this.</p><p><img src="/images/schedule_2Dwall_.jpg" alt="Schedule-wall"  border="0"  /></p><p>Our facilitator, &ldquo;Doc&rdquo; List, did an excellent job of setting the ground rules and clearing up a few scheduling hiccups and quickly we broke out into sessions.</p><p><img src="/images/opening_2Daltdotnet_.jpg" alt="Opening-altdotnet"  border="0"  /></p><p><strong>What&rsquo;s with all the white guys?</strong></p><p>The first one I went to was: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s with all the white guys? (Diversity)&rdquo; convened by <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog" target="_blank">Scott Hanselman</a>.&nbsp; We talked more about women in computing and why there is such a low ratio of men:women.&nbsp; Some argued that it was genetics, some argued that it was cultural or parental.&nbsp; We also talked about how Computer Science curriculums have highly technical weed-out courses at very freshmen levels.&nbsp; I think this breeds a group of smart people, but also tends to attract people with limited social maturity.&nbsp; This can either make it not fit for most women (if I am going to make some generalizations) or possibly make it a difficult environment for women.&nbsp; I think it&rsquo;s also good to note that in software, there is very much a &ldquo;people&rdquo; aspect that&nbsp;a very large percentage of CS majors would not qualify for.&nbsp; (MIS may be the answer to this, but at UH, some joked that MIS was for &ldquo;CS Dropouts&rdquo;).</p><p><img src="/images/diversity_.jpg" alt="Diversity"  border="0"  /></p><p>Scott talked about he has spoken at high schools to break down the technology behind MP3&rsquo;s, for example.&nbsp; Most of the audience wouldn&rsquo;t care, but there would be that&nbsp;2 or&nbsp;3 people that would take interest and that can make a difference.&nbsp; The 2 women that were in the room were encouraged to try that out.</p><p>I was happy to note that our female attendance this year rose 400% (to 4 women).&nbsp; Hopefully this number will change in future events.&nbsp; I think it&rsquo;s important for our community to be accepting and diverse.</p><p>After the session ended, we gathered in the main room again to chat for 10 minutes or so before the next session began.&nbsp; There were some really cool conversations going on around just about every corner.</p><p><img src="/images/conversations1_.jpg" alt="Conversations1"  border="0"  /></p><p><img src="/images/hallway_2Dconversations_.jpg" alt="Hallway-conversations"  border="0"  /></p><p><strong>To Mock or Not to Mock</strong></p><p>The next session I attended was about mocking.&nbsp; It was a pretty good fish-bowl session and a lot of good conversation was had.&nbsp; Towards the end it spun downhill due to some harsh arguments and I think this was the most &ldquo;unprofessional&rdquo; of all the sessions.&nbsp; Overall though, I got some good information about how some people manage pain with mocks and whether or not Auto Mocking Container is a design smell.</p><p><img src="/images/to_2Dmock_2Dor_2Dnot_2Dto_2Dmock1_.jpg" alt="To-mock-or-not-to-mock1"  border="0"  /></p><p><img src="/images/to_2Dmock_2Dor_2Dnot_2Dto_2Dmock2_.jpg" alt="To-mock-or-not-to-mock2"  border="0"  /></p><p>I will finish up the rest of the day in a later post, because I have to get ready to go to brunch!</p><div class="bjtags">Tags:<a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/altdotnet">altdotnet</a></div>
