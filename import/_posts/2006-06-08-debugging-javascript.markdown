<p>I haven&rsquo;t posted in a while, but I had to take 5 and post this today.</p><p>I stumbled across yet another fantastic plugin for Firefox today.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s called <a href="http://www.getfirebug.com/" target="_blank">Firebug</a>&nbsp; and it rocks.</p><p>If you&rsquo;ve used <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/venkman/" target="_blank">Venkman</a> before, you will appreciate this.&nbsp; Basically it&rsquo;s a complete Javascript debugger + DOM inspector embedded in Firefox. Here&rsquo;s a <a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2006/05/30/hewitt-firebug/" target="_blank">video</a> of it in use.</p><p>Life in the web development world suddenly got just a bit sweeter.</p><p><img src="/images/48_firebug_2Ddebugger_.png" alt="48_firebug-debugger"  border="0"  /></p><p>On a side note, why are there so many good web developer tools for Firefox, and the ones for IE leave something to be desired?</p>
