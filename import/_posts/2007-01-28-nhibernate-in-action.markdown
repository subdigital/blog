<p>Finally.&nbsp; <a title="amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/Nhibernate-Action-Pierre-Kuate/dp/1932394923/sr=1-1/qid=1169961755/ref=sr_1_1/104-1123499-0082348?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" target="_blank">A book on NHibernate</a>!!!</p><p>I was the first to guess that <a href="http://dotnet.org.za/kuate/archive/2006/12/27/NHibernate-Contest-_2D00_-Some-clues.aspx" target="_blank">this was the secret news</a>&nbsp;so I suppose I will be getting a free copy.&nbsp; Maybe I can be&nbsp;a technical reviewer for them (though I&rsquo;m sure they already have one lined up).</p><p><a title="blog" href="http://dotnet.org.za/kuate" target="_blank">Pierre Henri Kuat√©</a>&nbsp;should do an excellent job with the book, especially knowing that Bauer and King are behind him!&nbsp; (If you don&rsquo;t already know, they wrote the original <a title="amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/Hibernate-Action-Christian-Bauer/dp/193239415X/sr=1-3/qid=1169968944/ref=pd_bbs_sr_3/103-9117190-2218201?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" target="_blank">Hibernate in Action</a>&nbsp;&mdash; which is a must-have)</p>
