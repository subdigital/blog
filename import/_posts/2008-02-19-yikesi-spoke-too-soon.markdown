<p>I previously noted that I was outgrowing shared hosting and I migrated to a VPS account with VPSLAND.&nbsp;</p><p>I spoke too soon.&nbsp; <strong>Their prices are the lowest for a reason</strong>.</p><p>VPSLAND&rsquo;s support was good for the first 24&ndash;hours, but after that they neglected me.&nbsp; I opened a critical ticket because my sites (including this blog) were down for over an hour.&nbsp; I eventually fixed it on my own by some strange combination of disabling services and rebooting the server 3 or 4 times.&nbsp; 6 hours later a tech chimes in and says &ldquo;we checked your sites and everything is fine!&rdquo;&nbsp; &mdash; yeah, great help.</p><p><img alt="servers" hspace="10" src="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/480552_cmts.jpg" align="left" vspace="10" border="0" / /></p><p>I inquire as to why the system won&rsquo;t even serve up an empty subtext application and they told me that I should upgrade to a 1GB RAM plan (from 512mb).&nbsp; I figured I&rsquo;d need it eventually, so I obliged.&nbsp; It took them 12 hours to respond to my request.&nbsp; Meanwhile, one of my sites was acting sluggish and I couldn&rsquo;t get my friend&rsquo;s blog started b/c subtext kept timing out.</p><p>The next morning they told me my server was upgraded and everything was fine.&nbsp; But it wasn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I was seeing the same sluggish behavior and subtext was continually timing out (at the database level &mdash; but remember, this is an empty database).&nbsp; This time I know it&rsquo;s not RAM because I have 700 freakin megabytes free.</p><p>I eventually broke down and got a VPS plan at godaddy (512MB ram) for $37/month.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a little more money, but they set it up in about 45 minutes and it&rsquo;s worked flawlessly so far!</p><p>I also want to apologize to a certain reader who decided to go with VPSLAND after reading my post.&nbsp; He is also having troubles with them and I wish I had not posted such a glowing review so quickly after signing up.&nbsp; VPSLAND refunded my payment, so hopefully if you still have problems you can do the same.</p><p>Anyway, I will say that so far godaddy&rsquo;s plan is good, but I will not give them my Seal of Approval (TM) until I&rsquo;ve used it for a couple months.</p><p><em>(if you noticed the downtime, I apologize!)</em></p><div class="bjtags">Tags:<a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/godaddy">godaddy</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/vpsland">vpsland</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/vps">vps</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/hosting">hosting</a></div>
