<p><font style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #f4f4f4">Houston Tech Fest 2007&nbsp;was yesterday and it was an amazing success.&nbsp; Over 600 people were present and I was able to see a lot of old friends and meet some new &amp; interesting people.</font></p><p>I got to chill out with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/brada" target="_blank">Brad Abrams</a> and a few other folks from Microsoft, and it was great to meet <a href="http://codeslammer.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Scott Bateman</a> (fellow Houston blogger and advocate of Continuous Integration).&nbsp; His talk was most excellent, he was very informative and it showed that he not only understood the concepts, but he was able to explain it all in a way that (I thought) was easily grasped by the audience.</p><p>Some of the other speakers included <a href="http://www.michaelazocar.com/blog" target="_blank">Mike Azocar</a>, John Cook, <a href="http://www.timrayburn.net/" target="_blank">Tim Rayburn</a> (sorry I missed your talk again Tim!), and <a href="http://aspadvice.com/blogs/davidwalker/default.aspx" target="_blank">David Walker</a>.</p><p>Funny thing about Tim&rsquo;s talk.&nbsp; I was in the room next door listening to David Walker talk about SOA and WCF, and we could hear Tim through the wall partition.&nbsp; At one point I heard Tim say, &ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t hear me in the back, please shout out and let me know.&rdquo;&nbsp; I felt like shouting from our room <img src="/images/smile1_________________________________.gif"   />.</p><p>I had two sessions, Advanced CSS &amp; Javascript and ORM with NHibernate.&nbsp; In the first session, I had a full room (over 100 people!) and the audience was very engaging.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s great to have an audience that has so many questions and comments on what you are saying.&nbsp; It becomes more of a dialog, which I think makes the content so much more valuable for everyone.&nbsp; </p><p>Sometime in the midway point of the talk the projector just turned off.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s hard to give a talk on CSS without some visuals, so I continued typing and said &ldquo;Imagine if you wil&hellip;&rdquo; to a room full of laughter.&nbsp; About that time the projector turned on again.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t find out until later, but my friend Wes had sat on the cord and unplugged it, then silently plugged it back in.&nbsp; Funny how a room full of geeks and nobody thought to check the plug when it turned off.&nbsp; Ah well.</p><p>At the end of the talk I had a couple people come up to shake my hand and a little 4&ndash;year old girl came up, touched my arm, then ran away giggling.&nbsp; (Don&rsquo;t ask me&hellip;).&nbsp; I really enjoy giving this talk and I would like to branch outside of Houston and start giving it elsewhere around Texas (and the U.S.).</p><p>My second session was on NHibernate and it was more cozy, with only 15 people or so.&nbsp; I think NHibernate is a lot harder to make interesting for an intro class because it is a radically different way of developing applications that most people are exposed to.&nbsp; There is so much material to cover and only a short amount of time, so I tried to focus on the code and keep the examples short and simple.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it was effective, though I&rsquo;d like to branch off this talk and start giving more advanced lectures on NHibernate.</p><p>Thanks to all who came to the event (especially my sessions!).&nbsp; I hope you all had as much fun as I did.</p><p>The files from my presentations can be downloaded here:</p><p><a href="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/AdvancedCSSAndJavascript.zip" target="_blank">File Attachment: AdvancedCSSAndJavascript.zip (1161 KB)</a></p><p><a href="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/nhibernate.zip" target="_blank">File Attachment: nhibernate.zip (4001 KB)</a></p><p>Also, a lot of people were interested in the tools I was using during my demos.&nbsp; My favorite text editor is E, which you can get at <a href="http://www.e-texteditor.com/">http://www.e-texteditor.com</a>.&nbsp; My zooming tool that I use is called <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/Miscellaneous/ZoomIt.mspx" target="_blank">Zoomit</a>.&nbsp; My launching utility is called <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/Miscellaneous/ZoomIt.mspx" target="_blank">Launchy</a> and it saves me so much time everyday.&nbsp; I use <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper" target="_blank">ReSharper</a> for Visual Studio nirvana (seriously, get this tool).</p><p>Some links I mentioned at the talks:</p><p><a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">http://www.csszengarden.com</a></p><p><a href="http://www.exploding-boy.com/">http://www.exploding-boy.com</a></p><p><a href="http://www.mochikit.com/">http://www.mochikit.com</a></p><p><a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/">http://www.prototypejs.org</a></p><p>And finally, my favorite CSS book that I keep recommending to everyone:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.cssmastery.com/" target="_blank">CSS Mastery</a>.</p>
