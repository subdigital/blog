Get ready folks.&nbsp; History is in the making.&nbsp; The Earth will shatter.&nbsp; People will be enlightened.&nbsp; The sky will rain candy...<br><br>Ok, I'll stop now.<br><br>As you can see I'm really excited about the <a href="http://altnetconf.com">ALT.NET Conference</a> going on this weekend.&nbsp; I'm especially looking forward to (finally) meeting:<br><ul><li><a href="http://jpboodhoo.com">JP Boodhoo</a></li><li><a href="http://www.jameskovacs.com/">James Kovacs</a></li><li><a href="http://www.iserializable.com/">Roy Osherove</a></li><li><a href="http://martinfowler.com/">Martin Fowler</a> (seriously!)</li><li><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu">ScottGu</a></li><li><a href="http://graysmatter.codivation.com/">Justice Gray</a> (I hope you're as good-looking in person as you are on your blog, Mr. Gray)</li></ul>Sadly, I won't be able to meet Ayende Rahien as he won't be able to make it.&nbsp; I'm really bummed about that.&nbsp; Also, there are a ton of folks I've met before that I'm eager to catch up with.&nbsp; And, of course, I'm really interested in meeting NEW people!&nbsp; It's amazing the amount of excitement and vigor around this community.<br><br>I'll be driving in tomorrow night and should arrive around 8pm, so if you want to meet up for dinner/drinks (or if there is something official going on at that time) then drop me a line at ben {at} scheirman {dot} com.<br><br>I'm bringing my wife, however she's not so interested in the ALT.NET stuff.&nbsp; She's more interested in hanging out, having fun, and (probably) shopping.&nbsp; Maybe I can get her to attend 1 session, who knows.&nbsp; Maybe we can get her to stop teaching Spanish and start programming.<br><br>See you in Austin!<br><p></p>
