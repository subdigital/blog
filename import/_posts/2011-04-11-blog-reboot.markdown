My blog was feeling a little stale to me, hence my utter lack of content in the past few months.  I wanted to move it off of Windows hosting which really didn't make sense for me anymore.  Orcsweb graciously provided me with hosting through my MVP, and I would recommend their service to anyone.

But for me, it doesn't make sense to run a .NET blog anymore.  The days of "oh, maybe I'll be able to extend it somehow" have just not ever mattered much.  In the end, it was a pretty easy decision to move to Wordpress because it's easy to host, easy to extend, there's a gajillion themes & plugins, and the entire thing is fairly polished.  Sure, there's the nasty PHP underneath, but hey it lends itself well to simple hacking of the site to get things up & running.

So this is my attempt to freshen things up & encourage me to start posting more.  Let me know what you think!

<em>Side note: My blog has now had a total of 4 homes.  First was blogger, then dasBlog, over to GraffitiCMS, and now finally WordPress.</em>
