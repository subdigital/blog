<p>I love browser innovation.  I like seeing new features and I'm always eager to switch to the faster, better, more comfortable browser.  After hearing good things on Twitter, I was actually ready to put all my eggs in the Safari basket.  That is, until I tried using it for a week.</p>
<p>First, the good things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast. &nbsp;Comparable to Chrome speed.</li>
<li>Nice address bar search (though not as good as Chrome)</li>
<li><a href="http://flux88.com/blog/give-your-eyes-a-break-with-safari-5-reader/">Reader Mode +++</a></li>
<li>Plugins (though admittedly it made Safari a little wonky)</li>
</ul>
<p>These things are very welcome additions.  However it just wasn't enough.  I've permanently removed Safari from my Dock and set Firefox back as my default browser, and here's why:</p>
<ul>
<li>No Shift-CMD-T to open a previously closed tab</li>
<li>CMD-K doesn't take you to the search box</li>
<li>View Source doesn't highlight the HTML. Seriously.</li>
<li>XML &amp; JSON don't even render.  You have to view source to see the content.</li>
<li>CMD-Left &amp; Right doesn't switch between tabs</li>
<li>Tabs don't open next to the opening page.  Instead they all stack on the end.</li>
</ul>
<p>After I started making a list of things that annoy me, I came to realize that my old friend Firefox is the least bothersome browser I use.  Sorry, Safari 5.  I gave you a week, but you just didn't cut it.</p>
