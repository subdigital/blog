<div style="clear:both;"></div>Well I gave up on the old template because I recently was told that <b>nobody can reply to any of my posts!</b>I wonder what this has to do with the template that I was using, but I think that was the culprit.Maybe people actually <i>do</i> read this after all. :)<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
