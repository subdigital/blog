<p>I just upgraded to <a href="http://blogjet.com/">BlogJet</a> version 2, and I wish I had done it sooner!&nbsp; I always found it annoying that I couldn&rsquo;t add tags on the fly through <a href="http://blogjet.com/">BlogJet</a>, however now I can!</p><p>The interface looks a lot cleaner as well.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure I will uncover some other cool new features as I use it, but for now&hellip; if you&rsquo;re not writing to your blog with <a href="http://blogjet.com/">BlogJet</a>, go try it!</p>
