<p>Just a small announcement:&nbsp; I was recently awarded the INETA Community Champion Award!&nbsp; I'm finding that my community work is rewarding in many ways.&nbsp; Over the past couple years I have met so many influential people that have helped me (inadvertently) build my own career.&nbsp; I sincerely hope that any efforts I make in the community have a similar effect to others.</p> <p><img src="/images/ineta-community-champion_0bd55d8d-c604-407b-93c3-ba9e3d22cf61.jpg" alt="ineta-community-champion"  height="350" /></p>
