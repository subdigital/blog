<p>I just finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0321278658/qid=1130892388/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-2101494-1635314?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846" target="_blank">Extreme Programming Explained, 2nd Edition</a>, by Kent Beck.</p><p><img alt="" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0321278658.01._BO2,204,203,200_PIlitb-dp-500-arrow,TopRight,32,-59_AA240_SH20_SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg" border="1" /></p><p>The book is a very easy read, weighing in at 160 pages.&nbsp; I was able to <em>easily</em> finish it in the spare minutes I have during the day.</p><p>I thoroughly enjoyed the book and will be applying a few of the principles immediately at my job.&nbsp; I enjoyed taking a break from purely technical book and focusing on values and principles.&nbsp; There is also an extensive annotated bibliography in the back which will probably serve as my new-books-to-read source.</p><p>Next up is the Pragmatic Programmer, which I probably should&rsquo;ve read a LONG time ago, but always put it off.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll write a short review when I finish it.</p>
