<p><em>..and a short break from the technical posts&hellip;</em></p><p>I can hardly believe it&rsquo;s been a year (today) since <a title="last year on this day" href="http://www.flux88.com/2005/09/02/Mom+Loved+Life.aspx">my mom passed away</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have gone through a lot to come to terms with the fact that she is not with us anymore.&nbsp; Luckily we were (and are) surrounded by loving and supportive family and friends that help us through our hard times.&nbsp; For that I am truly thankful.</p><p>Sometimes I feel like I wish I could cry more about losing her, and other times&nbsp;tears just hit me &ndash; mostly when I&rsquo;m alone, driving and listening to music&ndash; when I am reminded of her.&nbsp; It feels good to cry about it every once in a while.&nbsp; It reminds me that I am human and that she still holds a large place in my heart.</p><p>My fiance, Silvia (who just started a blog herself) posted <a title="Remembering Pam" href="http://silvia.flux88.com/PermaLink,guid,606f7f98-6dbd-465c-beb6-aae39f35bf19.aspx" target="_blank">a touching memoir and scrapbook page</a> on her blog.&nbsp; Reading her comments makes me remember the good times we all had together, and not so much on the pain in the end.</p><p>I posted this link&nbsp;last year as well, but I want to post it again for my new readers to consider making a small donation to the <a href="http://www.ocrf.org/site/c.kwK0JbNTJtF/b.574943/k.CBC0/Home.htm" target="_blank">Ovarian Cancer Research Fund</a>.</p><p><strong>Now playing:</strong> <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZSearch.woa/wa/advancedSearchResults?artistTerm=A Perfect Circle">A Perfect Circle</a> - <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZSearch.woa/wa/advancedSearchResults?songTerm=Gravity&amp;artistTerm=A Perfect Circle">Gravity</a></p>
