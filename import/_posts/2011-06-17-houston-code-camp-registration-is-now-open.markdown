<h2>Houston Code Camp 2011</h2>
<h3>August 20th, 2011</h3><img src="/images/logo_____.jpg" style="float:right; margin: 25px;"   />
<p>Houston Code Camp is a free day of sessions relating to software development. The event is free to attend, but registration is required.</p>
<p>A Code Camp follows these rules:</p>
<ul>
  <li>They are a organized by developers and for developers to come and learn from their peers. Topics are always based on community interest and never determined by anyone other than the community.</li>

  <li>Code Camps are always FREE for attendees</li>

  <li>The success of the Code Camp is determined by the community. All content that is delivered is original and voted for by you! Make sure your vote counts, and vote for the sessions you'd like to see at our <a href="http://houstoncodecamp.uservoice.com/forums/116507-speaker-submissions" target="_blank">speaker submission site</a>.</li>

  <li>No Fluff - Code Camps are about Code, not slides. You won't find any marketing heavy powerpoint decks here</li>

  <li>All are welcome to attend and speak and do so without expectation of payment. Learn more about speaking on our <a href="http://houstoncodecamp.uservoice.com/forums/116507-speaker-submissions" target="_blank">speaking</a> page.</li>
