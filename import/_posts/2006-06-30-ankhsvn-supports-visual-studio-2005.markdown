<p>I just learned that <a href="http://ankhsvn.tigris.org/" target="_blank">AnkhSVN</a>&nbsp;now supports Visual Studio 2005.&nbsp; Sweetness.</p><p>Ankh is by no means a replacement for TortoiseSVN, but rather a plugin for VS that makes your life a bit easer.&nbsp; Tortoise and Ankh&nbsp;go hand in hand with each other.&nbsp; </p><p>Usually I commit my changes, add my files, and call Update directly from Ankh.&nbsp; Sometimes, for example with files outside of VS, I&rsquo;ll use tortoise.</p><p>In the event that something is screwed up, Tortoise is the way to go to get things on the right track again.&nbsp; You just have so much more capability with that tool.</p>
