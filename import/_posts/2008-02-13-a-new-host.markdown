VPS plans are a bit more expensive, but they are worth it.&nbsp; Why you ask?<br><ul><li>Remote Desktop into your box (no more crappy cpanel interfaces)<br></li><li>Install whatever-the-hell-you-want software (provided it's legal)</li><li>Run your sites in .NET 2.0, 3.0, 3.5, 6.0, whatever (ASP.NET MVC sites here I come)</li><li>Run ASP.NET, Rails, PHP all on the same server (if you want)<br></li><li>No more Medium Trust nonsense</li><li>control your own DNS (if you want)</li><li>run your own mail server (I use <a href="http://google.com/a">GAFYD</a> however)</li><li>point as many domains to whatever folders you want</li></ul>The downside:<br><ul><li>I have to track my bandwidth now.&nbsp; I have 200gb/month, which is good enough for now, but it could get expensive if I go over.</li><li>I only have 5gb of storage space.&nbsp; The base install takes 2gb.&nbsp; Yikes!&nbsp; I plan on making this 10gb sometime soon.</li><li>a little more expensive.</li></ul>Ultimately, I'm paying about $10/month more than shared hosting, and I think it's totally worth it.&nbsp; VPSLand's support is stellar so far.<br><br>Oh, and I have a question for you all:&nbsp; I plan on tinkering with rails, and I've read the long steps to get rails to work in IIS but should I?&nbsp; Or should I just install apache or Lighttpd and run it on port 81?<br>
