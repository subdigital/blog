<p>I just realized It&rsquo;s been a while since my last <em>technical</em> post, so I thought I&rsquo;d share my latest frustration. <em>(Don&rsquo;t you just <strong>love</strong> those?)</em></p><p>Today&rsquo;s frustration comes from the behavior of ToolTips in windows.&nbsp; By default, if a control has it&rsquo;s enabled property set to false (that&rsquo;s <em>disabled</em> for you boolean challenged out there) then it will not receive the required mouse events for tool tips to function properly.</p><p>So for my &ldquo;Save&rdquo; button on a form, if it&rsquo;s disabled, I&rsquo;d sure like to tell the user WHY it&rsquo;s disabled.&nbsp; To me this seems like one of the more common uses of the tooltip.</p><p>An image will definitely help:</p><p><img height="287" alt="DisabledButtonTooltip" src="http://ben.lyntonweb.com/blog/uploads/disabledButtonTooltip.jpg" width="408" border="1" /></p><p>To accomplish this I had to put something invisible&nbsp;behind the button, but it still didn&rsquo;t work properly, so you can see I shrunk the button just to get it to work.</p><p>I could display a status bar or something along those lines, but I don&rsquo;t want to <strong>complain</strong> to the user until they actually try to click &ldquo;Save Changes.&rdquo;</p><p>I read in MFC you can use PreTranslateMessage to allow WM_MOUSEMOVE to be passed to a disabled button, but I don&rsquo;t really have the time or the energy to do this in .NET. (unless someone else wants to give me some pointers&hellip;)</p><p>Sadly, a google search led me to only 1 possible quick-fix (putting a label or something behind the button and set the tooltip to that) &hellip;.&nbsp; but it didn&rsquo;t work. <img src="http://ben.lyntonweb.com/blog/uploads/smile9.gif" /></p>
