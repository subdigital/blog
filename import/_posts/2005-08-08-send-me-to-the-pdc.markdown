<p>&nbsp;Where do I start?&nbsp; <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/" target="_blank">Channel 9</a> is going to choose a blogger to go to the PDC for free, and armed with my new blog design I think it should be me&hellip;&nbsp; here&rsquo;s why: </p><div style="FLOAT: left; MARGIN: 2px"><a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc/pdcfriends.aspx?contest=true"><img alt="blogging my way to pdc" src="http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc/Flairs/Blogmyway-v.jpg" border="1" / /> </a></div><p></p><strong>I am young and my brain is like a sponge.&nbsp; </strong>I read as many books as I can find the time, and there are always 2 or 3 that I want to read next&hellip; ALWAYS.&nbsp; I read developer blogs religiously in hopes of gaining more knowledge in my travels as a developer.&nbsp; The deeper I go, the more I love it! <p></p><p><strong>I get more involved with the community every day</strong>.&nbsp; Since I completed my Computer Science degree at the University of Houston in December I have been posting questions and answers on the ASP.NET forums, I have published and updated an article on Code Project that got&nbsp;pretty good reviews, and I plan to give a &ldquo;tips n tricks&rdquo; presentation at the next Houston .NET User Group.&nbsp; This will be my first attempt at speaking,&nbsp;and I&rsquo;m a bit nervous, but I think it&rsquo;ll be fun and hopefully I can spread&nbsp;some of my experience to others.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>I attended my first conference recently, Houston DevCon 2005, and absolutely loved it.&nbsp; &nbsp;I can only imagine how fun it would be to attend.&nbsp; I pleaded with my boss to send me to DevConnections, then TechEd, and finally a local, cheap, 1 day conference came (DevCon) and I was able to attend.&nbsp; </p><p><strong>I am an active blogger.</strong>&nbsp; I try to post something worthwile every day or so.&nbsp; Since I find a lot of humor and professional advice in the blogs I read, I hope to pass that on to some junior developers trying to make sense of it all.&nbsp; Hopefully my experiences and thoughts might help others aspiring to be successful developers.</p><p><strong></strong>I know everybody is going to do this, but it&rsquo;s still valid.&nbsp;I vow to blog religiously about my experiences at the PDC, take pictures and post them here, and generally spread my enthusiasm about the developer community to others.&nbsp; I might get a little creative with my camera and try and do some amateur interviews.</p><p><strong>Finally, my kids just&nbsp;want me to shutup about it!</strong>&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been talking about going for so long now, they can&rsquo;t stand it!&nbsp; </p><p align="center"><img height="304" alt="Pdcbanner" src="http://ben.lyntonweb.com/blog/uploads/pdcbanner.jpg" width="400" align="textTop" border="1" / /></p><p align="center">I even have some audio supporters!&nbsp; Listen to them recommend me!&nbsp; </p><p align="center">(umm, no, they aren&rsquo;t robots &mdash; what are you, nuts?)</p><p align="center"><a href="http://ben.lyntonweb.com/blog/uploads/robotVoicePDC.wav">Mike</a> wants me to go.</p><p align="center">So does <a href="http://ben.lyntonweb.com/blog/uploads/robotVoicePDC2.wav">Crystal</a></p><p align="center"><a href="http://ben.lyntonweb.com/blog/uploads/robotVoicePDC3.wav">Even Rosa, the hispanic lady at the local dry cleaners wants me to go!</a>&nbsp;(hey, how does she know I like .NET?)</p><p align="center">(oh, and thanks for looking!)</p>
