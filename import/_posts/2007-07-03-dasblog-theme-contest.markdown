<p>In an effort to get some more good quality themes ready for the next release of dasBlog, I&rsquo;m going to host a little contest.</p><p>Introducing...</p><h2>The dasBlog Theme Contest</h2><p>The idea is simple.&nbsp; Submit a new dasBlog theme, created by you, using valid XHTML and CSS.&nbsp; Entries should be original and should be zipped up and sent to me at <a href="mailto:subdigital_AT_gmail_DOT_com">subdigital_AT_gmail_DOT_com.</p><p></a>Are you ready for the prize?&nbsp; How about &hellip;</p><h3>A <span>$100 (US)</span> Amazon Gift Card !</h3><p>The rules:</p><ul><li>Mockups do not count.&nbsp; They have to be either running online in dasBlog or submit the relevant files so that I can install them on a test blog.</li><li><em>Hint:&nbsp; we respect valid XHTML and CSS.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t abuse tables!</em></li><li>Multiple entries may be sumitted by the same person</li><li>Entries must be submitted to <strong>me</strong> no later than Midnight, <strike>July 12<sup>th</sup>. (That doesn&rsquo;t leave much time!)</strike> <font color="#ff6600">The deadline has been extended to July 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2007.&nbsp; Get started!</font></li><li>Send them to my email address (above) with the subject line <strong>dasBlog Theme Contest Submission</strong></li><li>No&nbsp;licensed material on the&nbsp;theme &mdash; all images and artifacts must be made by you or publicly available</li><li>By submitting&nbsp; you agree to allow us to package the theme along with dasBlog, if we so desire</li><li>You are allowed to place a small link at the bottom of the page identifying you or company, but no logos</li><li>The dasBlog team will judge the designs and the winner will be announced <strike>July 16<sup>th</sup> </strike><font color="#ff6600">July 25<sup>th</sup>.</font></li></ul><p>&nbsp;<em>The&nbsp;prize for this contest has been donated by <a href="http://www.computerzen.com/" target="_blank">Scott Hanselman</a> and myself.</em></p><h3>So how do I create a theme?</h3><p>Creating a theme is simple!&nbsp; The best way to learn is to open up one of the existing themes and take a look.&nbsp; The basic structure of a theme is this:</p><p>Inside of your dasBlog directory there is a <strong>themes</strong> folder:</p><p><img src="/images/blog_theme1_small_.jpg" alt="Blog_theme1"  border="0"  /></p><p>Each theme that you want to create (or install) goes in its own folder.&nbsp; dasBlog ships with over 20 themes currently, so there are a lot to choose from as a starting point.&nbsp; If you open the directory and take a look, you&rsquo;ll see a folder for each.</p><p><img src="/images/blog_theme2_small_.jpg" alt="Blog_theme2"  border="0"  /></p><p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at <strong>mono</strong>.</p><p>Inside of the specific theme&rsquo;s folder you&rsquo;ll find all artifacts for the theme.&nbsp; Any images, css, or template files go in here.</p><p>As you can see, there isn&rsquo;t much to it&hellip;</p><p><img src="/images/blog_theme3_small1_.jpg" alt="Blog_theme3"  border="0"  /></p><p>&nbsp;Notice the <strong>theme.manifest</strong> file here.&nbsp; This is just a text file telling dasBlog that this folder is a theme and <em>mono</em> is its name.</p><p><img src="/images/blog_theme4_small_.jpg" alt="Blog_theme4"  border="0"  /></p><p>You also have the opportunity to add named images, but you don&rsquo;t have to do that if you don&rsquo;t want to.</p><p>The next thing I want to open up are the 3 template files:</p><ul><li><strong>homeTemplate.blogtemplate</strong> &ndash; this is the main site layout.&nbsp; This will be the most complicated template.<br /></li><li><strong>dayTemplate.blogtemplate</strong> &ndash; each day there are zero or more posts, usually with a date header at the top, but possibly other groupings by day.&nbsp; This template will be rendered once per day (as long as there are posts on that day).<br /></li><li><strong>itemTemplate.blogtemplate</strong> &ndash; this is the post template.&nbsp; Included is the template for the entire comments structure.</li></ul><p>I will show the homeTemplate right here, just to give you an idea of what it&rsquo;s like to edit the themes.</p><p><img src="/images/blog_theme5_small_.jpg" alt="Blog_theme5"  border="0"  /></p><p>Most of this is standard XHTML, however you&rsquo;ll notice the macro tags marked with &lt;% %&gt;.&nbsp; These will be picked up by the renderer and replaced with whatever the macro calls for.&nbsp; For example, to tell dasBlog to output your administration bar at a certain location, you&rsquo;d write <strong>&lt;% newtelliigence.adminBar()%&gt;.</strong></p><p>For a complete list of dasBlog macros, check John Forsythe&rsquo;s page on macros:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.jforsythe.com/jforsythe/projects/dasBlogMacros.html">http://www.jforsythe.com/jforsythe/projects/dasBlogMacros.html</a></p><p>That&rsquo;s enough of an introduction to get you started, so&hellip;.</p><h2>Good Luck!</h2><div class="bjtags">Tags:<a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/dasBlog">dasBlog</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/contest">contest</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/theme">theme</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/css">css</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/xhtml">xhtml</a></div>
