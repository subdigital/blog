<p>Silvia&rsquo;s family is in town, and it is a lot of fun to have so many kids in the house.&nbsp; They (9 people) drove down from upstate New York.&nbsp; It took them about 23 hours driving time and they were very tired when they arrived.</p><p>On Christmas Eve, we all spent about 4 hours wrapping gifts and talking over coffee.&nbsp; It was fun, but we were all exhausted.</p><p>We had presents for all of the children, and it was quite a sight!&nbsp; We probably had 80 presents under the tree.&nbsp; The morning arrived and the kids went crazy!&nbsp; There was wrapping paper everywhere, but I think everyone enjoyed their gifts.</p><p>I received a Zune from Silvia, which I will write about next.</p><p>Silvia&rsquo;s family will stay for our wedding, which happens this Saturday.</p>
