<div style="clear:both;"></div>I finally made the switch from IE (long-time user) to Mozilla Firefox and I can't believe I didn't do this sooner!IE is very annoying compared to Firefox, and is riddled with security flaws. My favorite feature is how you can break out of framed pages, such as those that open from links inside hotmail messages....very cool.<br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
