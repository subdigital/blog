<p>People who know me can tell you that I have about zero patience for software.&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially software that is so integral to my day-to-day use of the computer.</p><p>One such program is my media player.&nbsp; I have tried pretty much every single one out there, and I haven&rsquo;t been too impressed with any of them.&nbsp; I constantly evaluate these programs and usually just end up settling.&nbsp; </p><p><em>(I should also note that I&rsquo;m probably the only person on the planet that doesn&rsquo;t have an iPod.&nbsp; Heck, </em><a title="pope has an ipod" href="http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0601282.htm" target="new"><em>even the Pope has one</em></a><em>!)</em></p><ul><li><strong>Windows Media Player &ndash; </strong>The library integration is weak and not very usable for me.&nbsp; The built-in cd burner is piss-poor, and I generally don&rsquo;t like the interface.&nbsp; I usually just use this for viewing temporary media (like my phone&rsquo;s voicemail or little video clips).&nbsp;&nbsp;The built-in taskbar toolbar is KICKASS and more media players should do this.</li><li><strong>WinAMP</strong> &ndash; Fantastic for a file-based collection, but I have grown to need more.&nbsp; My library was out of control and I was tired of manually tagging/renaming.&nbsp; The media library didn&rsquo;t suit me.&nbsp; The visualizations are top-notch and the skin community is HUGE.&nbsp; I like the interface, but again, I needed more control over my library.</li><li><strong>MusicMatch </strong>&ndash; As much as I&rsquo;d like this one to work for me, it still didn&rsquo;t feel right.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t get a good view of my music, and I was sick of it trying to get me to subscribe to it&rsquo;s mp3 download service.&nbsp; I uninstalled it.</li><li><strong>iTunes &ndash; </strong>I have chosen to stick with this one for now.&nbsp; The interface is pretty well thought-out and I really like the smart playlists.&nbsp; The ability to share music on the local network is very nice, though I&rsquo;d like this to be able to stream over the internet as well (authenticated, of course).&nbsp; It has decent support for podcast subscriptions, though a bit-torrent-aware plugin would be nice for this.&nbsp; I also like the ability to rate songs easily.</li></ul><p>I gathered some tips on generating some good smart playlists from <a title="andy budd's blogography" href="http://www.andybudd.com/archives/2005/08/itunes_smart_playlists/index.php" target="_blank">Andy Budd</a>.&nbsp; Basically this keeps my playlists <em>alive</em> and I can rate songs to help shape the playlists.&nbsp; I can un-check songs that I don&rsquo;t want to be included in ANY playlist (like stand-up comedy, podcasts,&nbsp;or 0:20 long tracks that are skits or preludes to other songs on the same cd).</p><p>So now that the media situation was settled, I needed a nice way to keep my music in sync from my desktop and laptop (at work).&nbsp; I&rsquo;d still like streaming ability over the internet, but these are the machines I use most, so they&rsquo;ll have to do.&nbsp; At the advice of <a title="computer zen" href="http://www.computerzen.com/" target="_blank">Scott Hanselman</a>&nbsp;I decided to give <a title="foldershare" href="https://www.foldershare.com/" target="_blank">FolderShare</a> another go.&nbsp; This time around I noticed that 2 things changed:</p><ul><li>Microsoft bought them out</li><li>Now it&rsquo;s FREE!</li></ul><p>This definitely got me interested.&nbsp; I decided to setup my mp3 folder as my share folder and installed FolderShare on both PCs.&nbsp; When I get new music in, I import it using iTunes (which copies and renames the files) and will automatically be synchronized with the other PC.&nbsp; That means I can import music on either my laptop or my desktop and everything will stay organized.&nbsp; This is a big plus for me.</p><p>So far this is working out fairly well.&nbsp; If I rename or change the tag of a file, then the whole file has to be transferred back to the other PC, so this can use up quite a bit of bandwidth.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t run into any issues with this so far.</p><p>Some other cool music links are:</p><ul><li><a title="musicbrainz" href="http://musicbrainz.org/" target="_blank">MusicBrainz Tagger</a> &ndash; This open-source free service is a GREAT idea.&nbsp; Basically it will scan your mp3&rsquo;s, make a digital footprint of each one, then try to match it with the online database.&nbsp; It will give you a percentage of confidence so you can setup to automatically tag those files that are 90% or greater and sift through the ones it wasn&rsquo;t sure about.&nbsp; If it cannot find a match, it will ask you to help the community out and supply some tag info.&nbsp; This can run in the background to automatically organize your mp3s.&nbsp; Very cool.</li><li><a title="itunes registry" href="http://www.itunesregistry.com/" target="_blank">iTunes Registry</a>&nbsp;&ndash; Upload your iTunes playlists and get suggestions based on data from the other uploaded playlists.&nbsp; See what other people are listening to.</li><li><a href="http://www.musicmobs.com/">music mobs</a>&nbsp;&ndash; Mark songs that you like and see what other people suggest.</li></ul><p>Are there any other helpful media links that I might add here?</p><p><strong><font color="#ff0000">UPDATE:</font>&nbsp; </strong>I recently saw some issues when synchronizing the folders that iTunes manages on both ends.&nbsp; If one iTunes collection modifies a filename or adds a file to the list, the 2nd iTunes will not pick it up, since I am not sync&rsquo;ing the iTunes .xml files.&nbsp; To fix this, I found a script that will scan your folder and re-import all of the songs.&nbsp; Best of all, this will&nbsp;*not* reset your playcounts, ratings,&nbsp;or tag info.&nbsp; This includes songs that were not already in your library, so it&rsquo;s perfect for me.&nbsp; If you use it, make sure and edit it to include your music directory.</p><p><a title="iTunes folder sync script" href="http://waves.ky/iTunes/iTunesFolderSync.js" target="_blank">Click here for the iTunes Folder Sync script.</a>&nbsp; Thanks to Garreth Farrington for this.&nbsp; (Anybody want to wrap this script in an easier-to-use app?)</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
