<p>This is just ridiculous:</p><p><img src="/images/vs_2Dcontext_2Dmenu_.png" hspace="10"  border="0"  /></p><p>I could seriously eliminate about 10&ndash;12 items from there <strong>and never miss them again</strong>.&nbsp; For the others that I use occasionally, they would be better served on a top menu, not when I right-click.&nbsp; All of the source control things should be grouped in a sub-menu or something, because this thing is just way too crowded.</p><p>Any way to control this chaos?</p>
