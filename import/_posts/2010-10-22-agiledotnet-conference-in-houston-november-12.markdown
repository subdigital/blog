<p>Improving is putting on an AgileDotNet conference in Houston (at the Microsoft Offices) on <strike style="color: #f00">Friday, November 12th</strike> <em>)Looks like the conference got pushed to February. Bummer!).</em> Word on the street is that it will be a mix of technical and project management related content! I heard great things about this conference's past incarnations and I look forward to attending this one.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and I'll be giving a talk on Git and why you should love it as much as I do.</p>
<p>At a price of only $49, it's really a no-brainer. Hope to see you there!</p>
<p>More registration and info can be found <a href="http://agiledotnet.com">here</a>.</p>
