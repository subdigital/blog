I was one of the early adopters for the Zune.&nbsp; My biggest attraction to it was the nice screen, which is great for watching movies on the busride to work.<br><br><img src="http://http://www.zune.net/xweb/zune/argoV2/images/ZuneLogo.gif"><br><br>Well now that the new Zune 2.0's are out, Microsoft released a much needed software update, both on the PC software side and the Zune firmware.&nbsp; If you have a 1st generation Zune, then go to <a href="http://www.zune.net">http://www.zune.net</a> and grab the latest software update!&nbsp; It's worth it!<br><br>Some new features:<br><ul><li>wireless sync<br></li><li>support for podcasts (finally)&nbsp; -- both in the PC software and the Zune itself</li><li>updated UI<br></li></ul><br><br><p></p>
