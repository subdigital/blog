<p>I've decided to transition over to a new blog.</p>
<p>The reasons? Mostly because I'm questioning more &amp; more the need to have a dynamic blog that I need to maintain. Static HTML blog generators are very interesting and I thought I'd give one a try.</p>
<p>I'll leave this one around for historical reasons. It gets a decent amount of traffic and has content going back to 2004.<br /></p>
<p>So without further ado I present my new blog, <a href="http://benscheirman.com">Fickle Bits</a>.<br /></p>
<p>(Note to RSS readers, your feeds will not auto-update. Subscribe to the new blog here: <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ficklebits" target="_blank">Subscribe</a> )<br /></p>
