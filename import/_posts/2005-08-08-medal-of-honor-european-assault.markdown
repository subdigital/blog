<p>I have been playing MOH: European Assault for XBox lately, and I think it is a pretty solid WW2 shooter.&nbsp; The controller gun action is pretty easy to get used to (I&rsquo;m so used to a mouse it&rsquo;s sometimes hard to play on a console).&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what is is that attracts me to WW2 shooters over others like Viet Nam or futuristic ones.&nbsp; Maybe it&rsquo;s the terrain, maybe it&rsquo;s the time period, I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m addicted and I play just about every single one that comes out.</p><p>One thing is bugging me though.&nbsp; Why is it that in just about EVERY World War 2 game I&rsquo;ve ever played snipers pop out of windows on the 2nd or 3rd floor, you shoot them, and they fall <strong>forward</strong> out of the window.&nbsp; For a genre of games that are supposed to be incredibly realistic, that just seems stupid.&nbsp; In 1944 did bullets actually pull people toward the shooter?&nbsp; Not only is this dumb because it happens, but also because it happens to <strong>ANYONE </strong>who is standing near a ledge.&nbsp; I know for a fact if I shoot this guy on the water tower that he&rsquo;s going to fall over the railing.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s a screenshot of what I&rsquo;m talking about:</p><p><img height="300" alt="Moh_falloutofwindow" src="http://ben.lyntonweb.com/blog/uploads/moh_falloutofwindow_small.jpg" width="400" align="textTop" border="0" /></p><p>Of all of the WW2 shooters out so far, here are my favorites:</p><p><strong>Brothers in Arms</strong> &ndash; I love the realistic team play.&nbsp; I rarely play a game like this twice, but this one was an exception.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t wait for BIA 2.</p><p><strong>Call of Duty</strong> (and expansion) &ndash; This game was so cinematic, it really kicked MOH out of my favorite spot for a while.&nbsp; I keep playing this one, simply because it&rsquo;s so immersive.</p><p><strong>Battlefield 1942</strong> &ndash; I played this game for hours on end.&nbsp; The sniper rifle was more realistic than you usually find in games (some people probably found it annoying, but I found it challenging).&nbsp; I got pretty good at hitting running enemies from 300 yards away, leading the crosshairs in front of their heads by about 2 inches.&nbsp; Yummy.</p><p><strong>MOH Frontline</strong> &ndash; I feel that this game really set the stage.&nbsp; It had a great soundtrack and really felt like Saving Private Ryan.&nbsp; The other Medal of Honors didn&rsquo;t quite capture the atmosphere like this one, but they were fun to play nonetheless.</p>
