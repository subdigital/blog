<p>All I can say about <a href="http://iphonedevcamphouston" target="_blank">iPhone Dev Camp Houston</a> is..... WOW. </p>  <p>Just check out the twitter stream (<a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23ipdchouston" target="_blank">#ipdchouston</a>) to see all of the buzz that was going on during the event. </p>  <p>I was asked to give an intro presentation, so at 10:00 AM I gave a quick overview of Objective-C and the iPhone SDK. When asked if the audience had much experience in iPhone development, only about 10% raised their hand. We decided that it would be time well spent to continue to delve into the intro material for another hour. </p>  <p>We covered the basics of the language, then jumped into an example using Interface Builder to link up UI elements to variables in a UIViewController and also wire up event handlers to control events on the view. The next demo was a demo of CoreAnimation I got from 31 Days of iPhone. My last demo covered UINavigationController and UITableViewController. </p>  <p>I'd like to thank all of those who attended the session, it was humbling to hear so much good praise and I'm glad the talk was well received. </p>  <p>You can download the presentation &amp; code demos here:</p>  <p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/312728/blog_files/iPhoneDevCampHouston2010.zip" target="_blank">iPhone Dev Camp Presentation &amp; Demo Projects</a>&#160;</p>  <p>The talk was also recorded (Thanks <a href="http://startuphouston.com" target="_blank">StartupHouston</a>!).&#160; Unfortunately the internet was being hammered and some of it is a little rough.&#160; These are the recordings:</p>  <ul>   <li>Part I:&#160; <a title="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/4323782" href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/4323782">http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/4323782</a></li>    <li>Part II: <a title="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/4323978" href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/4323978">http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/4323978</a></li>    <li>Part III: <a title="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/4324004" href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/4324004">http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/4324004</a></li>    <li>Part IV: <a title="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/4324971" href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/4324971">http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/4324971</a></li> </ul>  <p>You can find other recordings from the entire day over at the <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/startuphouston/videos/" target="_blank">Startup Houston UStream page</a>.</p>  <h2>App Jam</h2>  <p>Later in the evening I participated in an App Jam, where you basically start at 8pm and work all night until you have a working app. I had to leave around 12:30 because I was dead tired, and I created a rinky-dinky little app that I hope to finish up sometime soon. I might be wrong, but perhaps beer had something to do with not finishing? </p>  <p><img src="/images/5e9d1ec6-6a90-4940-af42-726ce84cdb75_3_.jpg" alt="5e9d1ec6-6a90-4940-af42-726ce84cdb75"  height="427"  /> </p>  <p>I'd also really like to thank the conference organizers... <a href="http://www.neror.com/" target="_blank">Nathan Eror</a>, Scott Riggins, Mike Gile, and many others for a really awesome event. I hope we do this again next year!</p>
