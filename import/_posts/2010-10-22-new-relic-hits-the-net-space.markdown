<p>New Relic is seriously awesome. It's pretty much the standard for performance monitoring in Rails. Recently New Relic introduced support for .NET apps. I think this is HUGE.</p>
<p>When I show off New Relic RPM to .NET developers, most are flabbergasted and ask...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why can't we have this in .NET?!?!?!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, now you can!</p>

<p>I made a comment (jokingly) on Twitter:</p>

<p>...The more I think about this the more I think I'm right. They have a proven track record in the Rails community and are a seriously valuable tool for troubleshooting bottlenecks and perf issues, all the way from the web tier to the database and back again.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how much of this is present in the current .NET version of their plugin, but I suspect that it will get more robust over time and be a standard in the .NET community as well.</p>
<p>I'm curious to hear from anyone who is currently using this. What is the setup experience like? If it's as "drop-in" easy as it is in Rails then it's a no-brainer. Let me know in the comments.</p>
