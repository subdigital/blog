<p>On Thursday, I was involved in a serious car accident.&nbsp; I hit a dump truck head on.</p><p>My car was mangled beyond belief, both airbags deployed, and I was in bad shape.&nbsp; My right leg was obviously broken;&nbsp;it looked like a pillow doubled-over on itself. (Ouch!)&nbsp; My left arm was also obviously broken.</p><p>Paramedics arrived quickly, they pulled me out of my car (quite painfully) and I was laid on a stretcher.&nbsp; I heard someone say &ldquo;be still, this might hurt,&rdquo; and then followed the most painful thing I have ever encountered.&nbsp; He pulled my leg to re-set my femur.&nbsp; My leg popped loudly 3 times while I begged him to stop.</p><p>I was put on a helicopter and flown to the hospital.</p><p>Later that evening I had surgery on my arm and leg.&nbsp; On my right femur, they inserted a titanium rod to fuse the bones back together.&nbsp; For my left radius, they inserted a few pins to fasten a loose piece of bone.</p><p>I stayed in the hospital until Tuesday evening.&nbsp; I am home now, basically immobile for I assume quite a while.</p><p>I guess I should consider myself lucky.&nbsp; I am thankful for&nbsp;all my friends and family who showed support and came to visit or called during this tragedy.</p>
