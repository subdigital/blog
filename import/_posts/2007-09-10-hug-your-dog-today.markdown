<p>My heart sank last week.&nbsp; Our dog, Molly, was hit by a car&hellip;</p><p>She was chasing after our other dog (a puppy) and crossed a busy road.&nbsp; We got the call and picked her up from a nice gentleman that kept her cool in his car (the Texas heat is around 100&deg; F outside).</p><p>She had a nasty laceration on her head and a bunch of scrapes and cuts.&nbsp; Molly had been rolled under a car and obviously suffered a large blow to the head.&nbsp; We rushed her to the Emergency Animal Clinic of Houston and they took her in.&nbsp; There was blood all over my car and my shorts.&nbsp; We were in complete shock.</p><p>Until this moment I didn&rsquo;t realize how much Molly really meant to me.&nbsp; She was always a great dog and I loved her, but I didn&rsquo;t take the time to pet her everyday and spend some time with her.&nbsp; My wife and I were pretty shaken up at the thought that she had almost died.</p><p>Our children were nearly devastated.&nbsp; None of us could believe that we almost lost her.</p><p>Molly was treated with&nbsp;6 staples to her head-wound.&nbsp; We picked her up the next day.</p><p><img src="/images/IMG_5838_small_.jpg" alt="IMG_5838"  border="0"  /></p><p><img src="/images/IMG_5825_small_.jpg" alt="IMG_5825"  border="0"  /></p><p>Her handkercheif reads &ldquo;They saved my life at the Animal Emergency Center of Houston.&rdquo;</p><p>She is still a little skiddish, but she has quickly returned to her normal self and we love her.&nbsp; Take the time to hug your dog today.&nbsp; Show them that you appreciate them.</p><p><img src="/images/IMG_5841_small_.jpg" alt="IMG_5841"  border="0"  /></p>
