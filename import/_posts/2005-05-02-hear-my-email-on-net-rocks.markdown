<div style="clear:both;"></div>Carl Franklin from <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com">.NET Rocks!</a> chose my email to read on the next show.Tune in and listen...<br /><br />For my prize I got to pick from their section of "useless crap", and I chose the big-ass coffee mug... because I can always use more coffee!(I guess I am not dorky enough to wear a skin tight baseball shirt or truckers hat that says ".NET Rocks!" on it... )<br /><br />If you aren't a regular listener, you should really try it out, most of the time you'll learn a thing or two new, and it's sometimes pretty funny.My favorite shows were with Scott Hanselman & Rory Blyth and Bill Vaughn & Rocky Lohtka.Here's a hilarious quote from the show:<br /><br /><blockquote><b>"I'm done with objects."</b><p align="right"><i>- Rocky Lohtka on .NET Rocks at Dev Connections 2005</i></p></blockquote><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
