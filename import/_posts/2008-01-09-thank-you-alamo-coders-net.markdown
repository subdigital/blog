<p>Last night I kicked off my <a href="http://www.flux88.com/ASPNETMVCTourOfTexas.aspx" target="_blank">Texas Tour of MVC</a> at <a href="http://www.alamocoders.net/" target="_blank">Alamo Coders</a> in San Antonio.</p><p>The room was pretty small and they filled it up with about 25 people.&nbsp; It was a bit more personal and cozy than the Houston .NET User&rsquo;s Group that I&rsquo;m used to.</p><p>I ran a bit short on time, but luckily I had my ready-baked turkey in another folder so I was able to show my ajax portion of the presentation and I think it went well.</p><p>I got some feedback from a few people who found the talk to be covering too much.&nbsp; (In addition to ASP.NET MVC, I&nbsp;covered inversion of control, mock objects, and a few other things).&nbsp; I wish I had a bit more time to explain these things in more detail, as it can be like drinking from the firehose, however I think they are important topics, and necessary to understand if you expect to properly unit testing on your controllers.</p><p>For those of you that were there, here are the relevant links for more information&hellip;</p><p>Inversion of Control:</p><ul><li>Excellent article by Martin Fowler explaining the concept &ndash; <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html">http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html</a>&nbsp; &ndash; </li><li>Castle Windsor &ndash; <a href="http://castleproject.org/container/index.html">http://castleproject.org/container/index.html</a>&nbsp;<br />(this was the container I was using)</li><li>StructureMap &ndash; <a href="http://structuremap.sourceforge.net/Default.htm">http://structuremap.sourceforge.net/Default.htm</a>&nbsp; (another excellent one)</li><li>Spring.NET &ndash; <a href="http://www.springframework.net/">http://www.springframework.net/</a>&nbsp; (the likely choice if you&rsquo;ve used Spring from Java)</li></ul><p>Mock Objects:</p><ul><li>Martin Fowler&rsquo;s article on the subject: <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html">http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html</a></li><li>RhinoMocks &ndash; <a href="http://www.ayende.com/projects/rhino-mocks/downloads.aspx">http://www.ayende.com/projects/rhino-mocks/downloads.aspx</a></li></ul><p>The javascript library I was using was prototype, available here: <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/">http://www.prototypejs.org</a>.<br /></p><p>Thanks again to Alamo Coders for having me!</p>
