<div style="clear:both;"></div><p>I wonder why Microsoft doesn't choose to update some of their <strong>most frequently used programs </strong>more often.&nbsp; I mean come on!&nbsp; When was the last time you saw an update to Solitaire for crying out loud.&nbsp; (Speaking of, there will be a new suite of card games, complete with nice gooey graphics updates, in Longhorn&hellip;.)</p><p>Anyway, one of those crappy programs is notepad, which I am glad to replace with something better.</p><p><a href="http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html" target="_blank">Download Notepad2</a>, then run <a href="http://webdevel.blogspot.com/2004_04_01_webdevel_archive.html#108246184802912349" target="_blank">this guy's batch file</a>&nbsp;to tell Windows to stfu and replace the notepad.exe file.</p><p>Now I get a decent editor to <em>View Source </em>in Internet Explorer!</p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
