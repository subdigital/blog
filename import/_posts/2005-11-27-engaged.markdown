<p>I proposed to my girlfriend, Silvia, on Thanksgiving in front of her entire family.&nbsp; She said yes!&nbsp; It was quite an occasion.&nbsp; We aren&rsquo;t yet sure when the date will be.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll post some pictures of our trip to upstate New York soon, one of them has me on one knee <img src="http://ben.lyntonweb.com/blog/uploads/smile1.gif" />.</p>
