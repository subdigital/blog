<p><strong>My thoughts on this edition:</strong></p>
<p>In this edition we took a different approach.  The first edition, while it reviewed well, had a barrier of entry.  It was purposely for the intermediate to advanced developer.  We wanted to make this 2nd edition approachable to the same audience, but also appeal to people who aren't expert developers.  I think we achieved that in the 2nd edition.</p>
<p>The book is broken down into 4 parts, each building upon concepts in the previous.  The parts are:</p>
<ul>
<li>High Speed Fundamentals</li>
<li>Journeyman Techniques</li>
<li>Mastering ASP.NET MVC</li>
<li>Cross-Cutting Advanced Topics</li>
</ul>
<p>Each chapter is completely self-contained as well.  It has its own examples, and they don't require knowledge of a previous chapter in order to understand the concepts.  This allows you to use the book for reference as well, which is something I'm proud of.  We worked very hard making sure that the examples were easy to follow, so what you'll find is clear instructions on the example pages themselves.</p>

<p>And a hat tip to <a target="_blank" href="http://jeffreypalermo.com">Jeffrey Palermo</a>.  He could literally write a book about managing the book process.</p>
<p>I really hope you enjoy this book.  And if you do pick it up, we'd certainly appreciate a review on Amazon.</p>
