<p>I gave a talk on Continuous Integration last night at the Houston Sark Office.&nbsp; Thanks to all who attended.</p><p>We had pizza and discussed some of the processes and principles behind CI, as well as some of the tools to get you there.&nbsp; I did a live demo of an app, connected to source control and a build server. </p><p>A-la <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2005/11/07/134400.aspx" target="_blank">Jeremy Miller</a>, I had my CCTray audio clips setup, so when the build failed, you&rsquo;d hear Napolean Dynamite say &ldquo;Freakin Idiot!&rdquo;</p><p>I think it went well, however for those of you who attended, I&rsquo;d really like to hear your thoughts!&nbsp; Please take a second to leave a comment.</p><p>Here are the files used in the demo:</p><p><a href="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/continuous_20integration.zip">continuous integration.zip (8323 KB)</a></p><p>(included are the sample project, cruise control config, and power-point slides)</p><p><em>I left out the build server installation because it was over 70mb.&nbsp; It consisted of Subversion binaries, Nant, and a Cruise folder with some project state data.</em></p><p>I got amazing help from <a href="http://jpboodhoo.com/blog" target="_blank">Jean-Paul Boodhoo</a>, who has a <a href="http://www.jpboodhoo.com/blog/NAntStarterSeries.aspx" target="_blank">9 part NAnt starter series</a>, which ends on a screencast of setting up CruiseControl!</p><p>Additional resources were:</p><ul><li><a href="http://jamesshore.com/Blog/Continuous-Integration-on-a-Dollar-a-Day.html" target="_blank">James Shore &ndash; Continuous Integration on a Dollar a Day</a></li><li><a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html" target="_blank">Martin Fowler &ndash; Continuous Integration</a></li><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Project-Automation-Deploy-Monitor/dp/0974514039" target="_blank">Pragmatic Project Automation by Mike Clark</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Expert-Delivery-Using-CruiseControl-NET-Experts/dp/1590594851" target="_blank">Expert .NET Delivery with CruiseControl and NAnt by Marc Holmes</a></li></ul>
