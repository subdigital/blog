I just got home from the Houston Dot Net User's Group, and it was agreat meeting.&nbsp; Not only did my whole team get to come along, but<a href="http://www.agiledeveloper.com/blog">Venkat</a> spoke about .NET Gotchas!<br><p>I really enjoy hearing him speak.I only wish we could have had a little bit more time for chit-chat after the meeting, but we got kicked out of the building right after the presentation ended.</p><p>Anyway, I'm going to try to sign up to give a 15 minute presentation for next month, hopefully they'll pick me this time :)<p>
