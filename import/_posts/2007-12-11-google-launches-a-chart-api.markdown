Google recently released <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/chart/">a URL API for charting</a>.<br><br>What's a URL API, you ask?&nbsp; Well you open an image to a specially formatted url, and google returns you a chart.&nbsp; You can do some pretty amazing things with this API.<br><br>Check out these samples:<br><img src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=lc&amp;chs=200x100&amp;chd=s:formostthisamazingdayfortheleapinggreenlformostthisamazingdayfortheleapinggreenl&amp;chxt=x,y&amp;chxl=0:%7CApr%7CMay%7CJune%7C1:%7C%7C50+Kb">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=lxy&amp;chs=200x125&amp;chd=t:0,30,60,70,90,95,100%7C20,30,40,50,60,70,80%7C10,30,40,45,52%7C100,90,40,20,10%7C-1%7C5,33,50,55,7&amp;chco=3072F3,ff0000,00aaaa&amp;chls=2,4,1&amp;chm=s,FF0000,0,-1,5%7Cs,0000ff,1,-1,5%7Cs,00aa00,2,-1,5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p3&amp;chd=s:Uf9a&amp;chs=200x100&amp;chl=A%7CB%7CC%7CD"><br><br>The last one was created with this url:<br><i>http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p3&amp;chd=s:Uf9a&amp;chs=200x100&amp;chl=A|B|C|D</i><br><br>The urls are a little bit cryptic as you can tell, but this allows you to use one source for charting regardless of your language or platform.&nbsp; A .NET wrapper is sure to spring up in the next couple days that will allow you to take advantage of this API with a more structured format.<br><br><b><i>Update:&nbsp; </i></b><i>Boy did I underestimate the community.&nbsp; Chris Pietschmann already created <a href="http://pietschsoft.com/Blog/Post.aspx?PostID=1429">an ASP.NET 2.0 Server Control to leverage the Google Chart API in .NET</a>.</i><br><br>I'm wondering how they are able to handle all of this.&nbsp; Not only is it a lot of traffic to handle (but they're obviously pros at that by now) but it takes a significant amount of CPU cycles to generate a graph like that on the fly.&nbsp; How do they keep their response times so quick?<br>&nbsp; <br><p></p>
