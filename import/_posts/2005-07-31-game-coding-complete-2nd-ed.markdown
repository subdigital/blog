<p><img src="/images/1932111913.01._AA240_SCLZZZZZZZ__.jpg"   /></p><p>Well my copy of Game <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1932111913/104-3718722-3341501?v=glance" target="_blank">Coding Complete, 2nd Edition</a>&nbsp;arrived on Friday.&nbsp; I knew it was going to be good after a good recommendation by <a href="http://www.managed-world.com/" target="_blank">Jason Olson</a>.</p><p>It is now Sunday afternoon and I am about 200 pages into it.&nbsp; I am really enjoying his attention to detail on topics that are often ignored in most online resources and even&nbsp;other game programming books!</p><p>This book really DOES belong on your bookshelf if you enjoy game programming at all.</p>
