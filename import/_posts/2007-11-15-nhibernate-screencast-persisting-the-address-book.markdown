<p>A few weeks ago, <a href="http://lostechies.com/blogs/evan_hoff/Default.aspx">Evan Hoff</a> posted a <a href="http://evanhoff.com/archive/2007/10/17/56.aspx">screencast</a> on building up a domain model in a test-first manner.&nbsp;&nbsp; We talked about it and thought it might be interesting to show how to apply persistence to this already functioning and tested domain model.</p><p>So <a href="http://flux88.com/screencasts/nhibernate-addressbook">take a look</a> and tell me what you think!&nbsp; It weighs in at 40 minutes (I tried to keep it under 30 but hey).</p>
