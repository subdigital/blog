  <div class="entry-content"><p>My current work computer has one of those crappy OEM Realtek Sound Manager craplet pieces of software.</p>


<p>I really hate it when hardware companies (especially sound card manufacturers) think that they should abandon the well-known and incredibly standard windows framed interface and invent their own scary window interface.</p>


<p>Anyway, I normally would never open this app, but it forces itself in focus when I plug in my headphones.&nbsp; (Yes, you read that correctly)</p>


<p><img src="/images/realtek.jpg" hspace="5"  border="0"  /></p>


<p>Umm, WTF?&nbsp; It obviously <em>knows </em>what I plugged in because it is highlighted and checked.&nbsp; The headphones don&rsquo;t work until I click OK on this box.</p>


<p>The worst part?&nbsp; Uninstalling the application renders the sound card useless.&nbsp; Pfft.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve had a bad case&nbsp;of Mac/Ruby envy lately.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll post more on the Mac thoughts later, this post is about <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a>.</p>


<p>If you don&rsquo;t know what RoR is, then maybe you should go to the website and take a look.</p>


<p><img src="/images/tadalist1_small.jpg" hspace="5"  border="0"  /></p>


<p>I keep seeing these Ruby applications that are so simple, elegant, and <strong>useful</strong>.&nbsp; Take <a href="http://www.tadalist.com/" target="_blank">tadalist</a>&nbsp;for example.&nbsp; This is a painfully simple application but it works the way I want it to and it&rsquo;s&nbsp;always available.</p>


<p>I use tadalist more than I&nbsp;use Outlook&rsquo;s todo list interface.</p>


<p>It&rsquo;s just so much cleaner, it&rsquo;s always available, and it doesn&rsquo;t get in your way.</p>


<p>Maybe this is due to the &ldquo;ruby way&rdquo; of thinking.&nbsp; I have seen countless applications written in JSP or ASP.NET that just look like someone vomited html all over the page.&nbsp; Where are all of the interaction designers in the .NET space?</p>


<p>Another&nbsp;Ruby application that I have seen that I think is incredibly useful and elegant is <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/" target="_blank">Basecamp</a>.&nbsp; This is a project management utility that is basically the Anti-Microsoft Project.&nbsp; They took all of the things that they didn&rsquo;t like about Project and built Basecamp, stripping down tons of features to boil down into the a simple, useful project collaboration application.&nbsp; Check out the screenshot to see what I mean.&nbsp; The interface is slick, and it has everything you need to know, right there.</p>


<p><a href="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/basecamp1.jpg"><img src="/images/basecamp1_thumb.jpg" hspace="5"  border="0"  /></a>I used this to collaborate on a small project and found it to be incredibly intuitive.</p>


<p>It isn&rsquo;t intuitive because it was written in Rails.&nbsp; It is intuitive because the <a title="37 signals" href="http://37signals.com/" target="_blank">people behind it</a> are brilliant.&nbsp; And these particular brilliant people swear by&nbsp;Rails.</p>


<p>Every time I try to use Project to get a hold of the overall picture of my current project I get lost, and I don&rsquo;t see much value in that beast of an application.</p>


<p><a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/" target="_blank">Thoughtworks</a> is jumping in as well into the ruby space.&nbsp; In&nbsp;a <a title="hanselminutes" href="http://hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=82" target="_blank">recent interview</a> with <a href="http://martinfowler.com/" target="_blank">Martin Fowler</a>, he claimed that somewhere around 60% of their consulting work is in Ruby now.&nbsp; 60%!&nbsp; I find that very hard to ignore.&nbsp; Check out their newest online application for managing agile projects:&nbsp; it&rsquo;s called <a href="http://studios.thoughtworks.com/mingle-project-intelligence" target="_blank">Mingle</a>, and it looks awesome.</p>


<p><a href="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/mingle.JPG"><img src="/images/mingle_thumb.jpg" hspace="5"  border="0"  /></a></p>


<p>I&rsquo;ve found 2 more ruby examples that I am really keen on:&nbsp; <a href="http://warehouseapp.com/" target="_blank">Warehouse</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://lighthouseapp.com/" target="_blank">Lighthouse</a>.</p>


<div><a href="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/warehouse1.JPG"><img src="/images/warehouse1_thumb.jpg" hspace="5"  border="0"  /></a><a href="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/warehouse2.JPG"><img src="/images/warehouse2_thumb1.jpg" hspace="5"  border="0"  /></a></div>


<div><p>Warehouse is a subversion repository browser with a slick interface.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s only 30 bucks, too!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lighthouse looks even cooler.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a bug tracking application that integrates with subversion and email.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d really like to take this application for a spin.</p></div>


<div><a href="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/lighthouse.JPG"><img src="/images/lighthouse_thumb.jpg" hspace="5"  border="0"  /></a></div>


<div>&nbsp;</div>


<div>These applications do share a common interface style, but that doesn&rsquo;t exactly mean it&rsquo;s a bad thing.&nbsp; The design of these applications is simple, polished, and actually pleasing to look at.&nbsp; Try to think about those things with Team Foundation Server and see if you get the same feeling.</div>


<div>&nbsp;</div>


<div>This raises the question, Why are Ruby Applications so Elegant?&nbsp; Well, not all are&hellip; but the majority are.&nbsp;&nbsp; </div>


<div>&nbsp;</div>


<div>I&rsquo;d say, some major factors are:</div>


<ul><li>The typical ruby developer is also a Mac user.</li><ul><li>the typical Mac user appreciates design.</li></ul><li>The mantra&nbsp;of &ldquo;less is more&rdquo; radiates from the language (Ruby), the web framework (Rails), and the interface.</li></ul>


<p>I&rsquo;m really jealous of the&nbsp;work that some of these folks are doing.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is&nbsp;contributing to my Mac Envy, which I will post on later.</p>


<p>Am I just becoming a fan-boy?&nbsp; What do you think?&nbsp;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><font style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #f4f4f4">I&rsquo;ve gotten a number of requests for this, so I&rsquo;ve decided to extend the deadline for the <a href="http://www.flux88.com/dasBlogthemeContext.aspx">dasBlog Theme Contest</a>&nbsp;until July 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2007.&nbsp; <strong>That gives 2 full weekends before the themes are due.</strong></font></p>


<p>As a reminder, there is a <strong>$100</strong> shiny Amazon gift card with your name on it if you can submit a slick-looking theme that impresses us more than the rest.&nbsp; So far the response has been lower than expected, which means your chances of winning are better!</p>


<p>Creating a theme is easy.&nbsp; It takes about 2 hours to get a fully working theme when you get used to the macros and the page layout, and maybe a few more to make sure that the site looks good in all major browsers.</p>


<p>I&rsquo;ve also received a number of similar questions, so I&rsquo;ll answer them here:</p>


<p><em>The rules for the contest state &lsquo;no licensed material&rsquo; &mdash; does that mean I can&rsquo;t use images under GPL, BSD, or Creative Commons?</em></p>


<p><strong>No.&nbsp; I wrote that more as a CYA requirement.&nbsp; Basically as long as there are no restrictions in distributing the artifacts along with dasBlog we&rsquo;re OK with it.&nbsp; Just be sure to ask permission where warranted and always give credit.</strong></p>


<p><em>I love the ________ theme from WordPress|MovableType|blogger|Subtext.&nbsp; Can I just port that?</em></p>


<p><strong>Absolutely!&nbsp; As long as you follow the rule above, we&rsquo;d love to see some familiar professional themes on dasBlog.</strong></p>


<p><em>I don&rsquo;t have a .NET environment to test out dasBlog&hellip; can I still participate?</em></p>


<p><strong>I will help out as much as I can.&nbsp; If you can provide me with a solid HTML template with all of the required pieces in place, I will try to help out getting it on dasBlog.</strong></p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>Any other questions?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In an effort to get some more good quality themes ready for the next release of dasBlog, I&rsquo;m going to host a little contest.</p>


<p>Introducing&#8230;</p>


<h2>The dasBlog Theme Contest</h2>


<p>The idea is simple.&nbsp; Submit a new dasBlog theme, created by you, using valid XHTML and CSS.&nbsp; Entries should be original and should be zipped up and sent to me at <a href="mailto:subdigital_AT_gmail_DOT_com">subdigital_AT_gmail_DOT_com.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<em>The&nbsp;prize for this contest has been donated by <a href="http://www.computerzen.com/" target="_blank">Scott Hanselman</a> and myself.</em></p>


<h3>So how do I create a theme?</h3>


<p>Creating a theme is simple!&nbsp; The best way to learn is to open up one of the existing themes and take a look.&nbsp; The basic structure of a theme is this:</p>


<p>Inside of your dasBlog directory there is a <strong>themes</strong> folder:</p>


<p><img src="/images/blog_theme1_small.jpg" alt="Blog_theme1"  border="0"  /></p>


<p>Each theme that you want to create (or install) goes in its own folder.&nbsp; dasBlog ships with over 20 themes currently, so there are a lot to choose from as a starting point.&nbsp; If you open the directory and take a look, you&rsquo;ll see a folder for each.</p>


<p><img src="/images/blog_theme2_small.jpg" alt="Blog_theme2"  border="0"  /></p>


<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at <strong>mono</strong>.</p>


<p>Inside of the specific theme&rsquo;s folder you&rsquo;ll find all artifacts for the theme.&nbsp; Any images, css, or template files go in here.</p>


<p>As you can see, there isn&rsquo;t much to it&hellip;</p>


<p><img src="/images/blog_theme3_small1.jpg" alt="Blog_theme3"  border="0"  /></p>


<p>&nbsp;Notice the <strong>theme.manifest</strong> file here.&nbsp; This is just a text file telling dasBlog that this folder is a theme and <em>mono</em> is its name.</p>


<p><img src="/images/blog_theme4_small.jpg" alt="Blog_theme4"  border="0"  /></p>


<p>You also have the opportunity to add named images, but you don&rsquo;t have to do that if you don&rsquo;t want to.</p>


<p>The next thing I want to open up are the 3 template files:</p>


<ul><li><strong>homeTemplate.blogtemplate</strong> &ndash; this is the main site layout.&nbsp; This will be the most complicated template.<br /></li><li><strong>dayTemplate.blogtemplate</strong> &ndash; each day there are zero or more posts, usually with a date header at the top, but possibly other groupings by day.&nbsp; This template will be rendered once per day (as long as there are posts on that day).<br /></li><li><strong>itemTemplate.blogtemplate</strong> &ndash; this is the post template.&nbsp; Included is the template for the entire comments structure.</li></ul>


<p>I will show the homeTemplate right here, just to give you an idea of what it&rsquo;s like to edit the themes.</p>


<p><img src="/images/blog_theme5_small.jpg" alt="Blog_theme5"  border="0"  /></p>


<p>Most of this is standard XHTML, however you&rsquo;ll notice the macro tags marked with &lt;% %&gt;.&nbsp; These will be picked up by the renderer and replaced with whatever the macro calls for.&nbsp; For example, to tell dasBlog to output your administration bar at a certain location, you&rsquo;d write <strong>&lt;% newtelliigence.adminBar()%&gt;.</strong></p>


<p>For a complete list of dasBlog macros, check John Forsythe&rsquo;s page on macros:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.jforsythe.com/jforsythe/projects/dasBlogMacros.html">http://www.jforsythe.com/jforsythe/projects/dasBlogMacros.html</a></p>


<p>That&rsquo;s enough of an introduction to get you started, so&hellip;.</p>


<h2>Good Luck!</h2>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m sure that most of my readers are the &ldquo;Family IT&rdquo; people&nbsp;to their relatives.&nbsp; You know, the kind of person that gets regular phone calls from parents, aunts, uncles, cousins, brothers, sisters, grandparents, kids, etc.</p>


<p>I have filled that role since I was probably 13.&nbsp; Most of the time I would just get annoyed, but now, in my infinite maturity (<img src="/images/smile1_______________________.gif"   />), I have fully accepted this responsibility.&nbsp; Here are the 10 steps you (and I) should take to win the <strong>Family IT Guy</strong> award&hellip;&nbsp; come on, you know you want it!</p>


<div style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><p><img src="/images/family_it_guy.gif" alt="Family_it_guy"  border="0"  /></p></div>


<p><strong>Step 1:&nbsp; Get a Good Backup Strategy</strong></p>


<p>It starts with a backup strategy.&nbsp; I have a 500GB Western Digital My Book that takes images of my home PCs and stores them.&nbsp; This pretty much works, except when my house burns down I have nothing.&nbsp; My wife has about 45 GB worth of family photos and digital scrapbooking material.&nbsp; It would be catastrophic to lose all that stuff.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s irreplaceable.&nbsp; Other data that is important to backup are digital scans of driver&rsquo;s licenses, social security cards, birth certificates, tax forms, etc.</p>


<p>So I setup both of our computers (mine and my wife&rsquo;s) on Carbonite online backup.&nbsp; Carbonite installs a little background process that will backup your files behind the scenes.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s less than $50/year and you can store <strong>unlimited</strong> data.&nbsp; Your data is encrypted and uploaded and you can pull it down at any time.</p>


<p>It also installs a little explorer overlay icon that shows you a blue, green, or yellow dot.&nbsp; Green means backed up, so your family knows they&rsquo;re safe.</p>


<p><strong>Step 2:&nbsp; Keep Spare Parts Around</strong></p>


<p>I can&rsquo;t begin to count how many times a family member has asked me for a network cable, or a sound card, or a network card, or just about any other piece of hardware that a computer needs.&nbsp; Since I do a lot of&nbsp;tinkering with computer hardware, I tend to have a lot of spare parts.</p>


<p>Your uncle will appreciate not having to order a new sound card for $15 at the local computer shop or (gasp!) online at&nbsp;<a href="http://newegg.com/" target="_blank">newegg</a>.</p>


<p><strong>Step 3:&nbsp; Keep a Digital Toolbelt on you &ndash; A 2GB USB&nbsp;Drive</strong></p>


<p>I have a copy of&nbsp;every tool from <a href="http://sysinternals.com/" target="_blank">SysInternals</a> on my&nbsp;USB&nbsp;Key.&nbsp;They are invaluable when digging deep into Windows problems.</p>


<p>I also put <a href="http://portableapps.com/" target="_blank">portable apps</a> such as <a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable" target="_blank">Firefox Portable</a> my thumb drive.&nbsp; This allows me to run a better browser when nothing but IE 6 is installed.</p>


<p>Also grab a copy of <a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/utilities/clamwin_portable" target="_blank">ClamWin Antivirus Portable</a><font color="#0066cc"> </font>(or <a href="http://www.clamwin.com/" target="_blank">regular version</a>)&nbsp;or another free AV program.&nbsp; You never know when you&rsquo;ll have a cousin jump out of the bushes and ask you to clean their laptop.</p>


<p>Keeping a thumb drive on you will make it a lot easier to use a family member&rsquo;s computer.&nbsp; The last thing you want to do is <em>have to come back later</em> with the right tools!</p>


<p><em>For a good list of essential tools, check out <a href="http://computerzen.com/tools" target="_blank">Scott Hanselman&rsquo;s Ultimate Tools List</a>.</em></p>


<p><strong>Step 4:&nbsp; Setup Family Email</strong></p>


<p>We&rsquo;re all tired of email addresses like <a href="mailto:JRod44222354@aol.com">JRod44222354@aol.com</a>. (Apologies if that is your email address.)&nbsp; I recently setup <strong>scheirman.com</strong> as my family domain name and gave most of my relatives their own email address.&nbsp; Most of them were pretty excited to have a <a href="mailto:firstname@lastname.com">firstname@lastname.com</a> email address.&nbsp; Of course if your last name is Smith, then you&rsquo;ll have to get creative.</p>


<p>To host the email I&rsquo;m using Google Apps for Your Domain and it works like a charm.&nbsp; Not only do you get all the goodness of GMail, but you get a personal email address as well!&nbsp; Their interface is slick and easy to use.</p>


<p><strong>Step 5:&nbsp; Advise on New Computer Purchases</strong></p>


<p>Don&rsquo;t let your Grandmother buy that new computer from the neigbor kid down the street.&nbsp; If you see your cousin walk into the Sony Style store at the mall with an armload of cash, <strong>stop her</strong>.&nbsp; </p>


<p>Computers are cheap.&nbsp; Unless you want a high-end gaming rig or a video processing machine, your standard Dell fare will do you just fine, and often times under $600.&nbsp; It comes with a warranty, which saves you a headache for at least a year <img src="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/smile1.gif" />.</p>


<p><strong>Step 6:&nbsp; Get a Remote Access Plan</strong></p>


<p>When your sister calls you from Montana and says she needs help adding a user to her computer, be ready.&nbsp; With some good remote access software it can be painless to just take control and do it for her.</p>


<p><a href="http://copilot.com/" target="_blank">FogCreek Copilot</a> is supposed to be good.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/" target="_blank">Joel Spolsky</a><font color="#0066cc">&rsquo;s</font> company <a href="http://www.fogcreeksoftware.com/" target="_blank">Fog Creek Software</a> wrote it and I have heard good reviews.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very cheap for about an hour of use and <em>&ldquo;it just works.&rdquo;</em></p>


<p><img src="/images/crossloop_screenshot_small.jpg" alt="Crossloop_screenshot_small"  border="0"  /></p>


<p>CrossLoop is a tool I just tried out the other day, and it also &ldquo;just works.&rdquo;&nbsp; You and your relative can download this in less than a minute, run it, and be connected even behind firewalls.&nbsp; Best of all, it&rsquo;s free!</p>


<p>I used this the other day when I was helping my wife upload some files to her blog with an FTP client.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t have much time and it was a bit difficult to explain over the phone, so I told her to download the client, click &ldquo;Host&rdquo;&nbsp;and then read me the number on the screen.&nbsp; </p>


<p>That&rsquo;s all it took!</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p><strong>Step 7:&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t Get Annoyed</strong></p>


<p>PC Enthusiasts frequently whine and moan about having to help their relatives about how to use the computer.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s easy for us because we use it everyday.&nbsp; Many non-techies perceive computer gurus like they do auto mechanics or lawyers.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t want this kind of image!</p>


<p>The next time you walk up to your computer, take a look at how many buttons there are.&nbsp; What if your Grandmother sat down for the first time to use a PC?&nbsp; It is incredibly intimidating and complicated.&nbsp; How did <em>you</em> react when you first got a virus?&nbsp; </p>


<p>Cut your family some slack.&nbsp; <strong>Be Patient</strong>.</p>


<p><strong>Step 8:&nbsp; Spread the word.&nbsp; </strong></p>


<p>Get your peeps using Firefox instead of Internet Explorer.&nbsp; Tell them the wonders of GMail.&nbsp; Explain to them that there&rsquo;s more than the MSN home page.&nbsp; Getting the word out is the only way you can ever expect people to <em>see the light</em>.</p>


<p>When someone forwards you an email with a taseless joke or a reason why you should thank the heavens for waking up in the morning, only in ALL CAPS&hellip; politely inform them of internet etiquette.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t just push the SPAM button.</p>


<p>I bought my dad a copy of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lifehacker-Tech-Tricks-Turbocharge-Your/dp/0470050659" target="_blank">Lifehacker book</a> for Christmas last year.&nbsp; He lov
ed it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s full of useful tools and tricks to make your computer work for you.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a computer guy, mind you&hellip; but not the typical person who would read <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/">www.lifehacker.com</a> on a daily basis (though now he proabably does).</p>


<p><strong>Step 9:&nbsp; Find a Protogé</strong></p>


<p>You can&rsquo;t do this stuff forever.&nbsp; Look at the younger folks in your family that can help take the throne.&nbsp; Tell them, &ldquo;One day&hellip;.&nbsp; this will all be yours&hellip;&rdquo;</p>


<p>Be a mentor about good computer usage and troubleshooting.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be stingy with The Badge.&nbsp; Pass it on.</p>


<p><strong>Step 10:&nbsp; Let Your Family Know Your Other Interests</strong></p>


<p>I enjoy playing guitar, swimming, grilling food with family, playing board games, reading books, watching movies and addicting TV shows.&nbsp; If all you talk about is World of Warcraft, <strong>people are going to think you are weird</strong>.&nbsp; Let your family know that you are at least a tad normal, and that you do enjoy sunlight once in a while.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>So there you have it, there are my 10 steps to becoming a good Family IT Guy.&nbsp; A lot of my Family IT Guy inspiration comes from <a href="http://computerzen.com/" target="_blank">Scott Hanselman</a>, who seems to have all this down pretty darn good.&nbsp; I hope his family knows how good they have it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been running Vista for about&nbsp;6 months now, and I really like it.&nbsp; There are a lot of issues that I have run into, but some of the minor ones are easy to fix.</p>


<p>For example, I downloaded <a href="http://e-texteditor.com/" target="_blank">e-texteditor</a>&nbsp;which is like TextMate for Windows.&nbsp; It uses Cygwin for some advanced features, so when you try to use then (like Alt-Shift-Comma for auto-wrapping html brackets and closing tags on a word) &mdash; E goes to install <a href="http://cygwin.com/" target="_blank">Cygwin</a>.&nbsp; Under Vista, clicking on &ldquo;Install&rdquo; does nothing.</p>


<p><a href="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/e.JPG"><img src="/images/e_thumb.jpg" alt="E - a TextMate clone for Windows"  border="0"  /></a></p>


<p>The solution is to Run as Administrator.&nbsp; A lot of programs out there aren&rsquo;t testing on Vista so they don&rsquo;t realize that many of the features require elevated access, and if they silently suppress the issue, the user never knows what&rsquo;s going wrong.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the fault of the application, not Vista.</p>


<p>SQL Management Studio Express does this to me as well.&nbsp; I always have to run that program as Administrator.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I installed Visual Studio Team Edition for Database Professionals the other day and I was about to create my first DB Pro project.</p>


<p>Check out the New Project dialog box.&nbsp; This is with VSTS Developer,&nbsp;and DB Pro installed:</p>

<p>and&hellip;</p>


<p><img src="/images/image002.jpg" alt="Image002"  border="0"  /></p>


<p>Seeing as how I never used the standard database project in Visual Studio before, I couldn&rsquo;t tell which one I was supposed to choose.&nbsp; </p>


<p>It turns out that you need to pick the one in the 2<sup>nd</sup> screenshot, the Microsoft SQL Server project.&nbsp; </p>


<p>Wasn&rsquo;t very intuitive which project to choose.</p>
