  <div class="entry-content"><p><font style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #f4f4f4">I&rsquo;ve gotten a number of requests for this, so I&rsquo;ve decided to extend the deadline for the <a href="http://www.flux88.com/dasBlogthemeContext.aspx">dasBlog Theme Contest</a>&nbsp;until July 22<sup>nd</sup>, 2007.&nbsp; <strong>That gives 2 full weekends before the themes are due.</strong></font></p>


<p>As a reminder, there is a <strong>$100</strong> shiny Amazon gift card with your name on it if you can submit a slick-looking theme that impresses us more than the rest.&nbsp; So far the response has been lower than expected, which means your chances of winning are better!</p>


<p>Creating a theme is easy.&nbsp; It takes about 2 hours to get a fully working theme when you get used to the macros and the page layout, and maybe a few more to make sure that the site looks good in all major browsers.</p>


<p>I&rsquo;ve also received a number of similar questions, so I&rsquo;ll answer them here:</p>


<p><em>The rules for the contest state &lsquo;no licensed material&rsquo; &mdash; does that mean I can&rsquo;t use images under GPL, BSD, or Creative Commons?</em></p>


<p><strong>No.&nbsp; I wrote that more as a CYA requirement.&nbsp; Basically as long as there are no restrictions in distributing the artifacts along with dasBlog we&rsquo;re OK with it.&nbsp; Just be sure to ask permission where warranted and always give credit.</strong></p>


<p><em>I love the ________ theme from WordPress|MovableType|blogger|Subtext.&nbsp; Can I just port that?</em></p>


<p><strong>Absolutely!&nbsp; As long as you follow the rule above, we&rsquo;d love to see some familiar professional themes on dasBlog.</strong></p>


<p><em>I don&rsquo;t have a .NET environment to test out dasBlog&hellip; can I still participate?</em></p>


<p><strong>I will help out as much as I can.&nbsp; If you can provide me with a solid HTML template with all of the required pieces in place, I will try to help out getting it on dasBlog.</strong></p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>Any other questions?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In an effort to get some more good quality themes ready for the next release of dasBlog, I&rsquo;m going to host a little contest.</p>


<p>Introducing&#8230;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<em>The&nbsp;prize for this contest has been donated by <a href="http://www.computerzen.com/" target="_blank">Scott Hanselman</a> and myself.</em></p>


<h3>So how do I create a theme?</h3>


<p>Creating a theme is simple!&nbsp; The best way to learn is to open up one of the existing themes and take a look.&nbsp; The basic structure of a theme is this:</p>


<p>Inside of your dasBlog directory there is a <strong>themes</strong> folder:</p>


<p><img src="/images/blog_theme1_small.jpg" alt="Blog_theme1"  border="0"  /></p>


<p>Each theme that you want to create (or install) goes in its own folder.&nbsp; dasBlog ships with over 20 themes currently, so there are a lot to choose from as a starting point.&nbsp; If you open the directory and take a look, you&rsquo;ll see a folder for each.</p>


<p><img src="/images/blog_theme2_small.jpg" alt="Blog_theme2"  border="0"  /></p>


<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at <strong>mono</strong>.</p>


<p>Inside of the specific theme&rsquo;s folder you&rsquo;ll find all artifacts for the theme.&nbsp; Any images, css, or template files go in here.</p>


<p>As you can see, there isn&rsquo;t much to it&hellip;</p>


<p><img src="/images/blog_theme3_small1.jpg" alt="Blog_theme3"  border="0"  /></p>


<p>&nbsp;Notice the <strong>theme.manifest</strong> file here.&nbsp; This is just a text file telling dasBlog that this folder is a theme and <em>mono</em> is its name.</p>


<p><img src="/images/blog_theme4_small.jpg" alt="Blog_theme4"  border="0"  /></p>


<p>You also have the opportunity to add named images, but you don&rsquo;t have to do that if you don&rsquo;t want to.</p>


<p>The next thing I want to open up are the 3 template files:</p>


<ul><li><strong>homeTemplate.blogtemplate</strong> &ndash; this is the main site layout.&nbsp; This will be the most complicated template.<br /></li><li><strong>dayTemplate.blogtemplate</strong> &ndash; each day there are zero or more posts, usually with a date header at the top, but possibly other groupings by day.&nbsp; This template will be rendered once per day (as long as there are posts on that day).<br /></li><li><strong>itemTemplate.blogtemplate</strong> &ndash; this is the post template.&nbsp; Included is the template for the entire comments structure.</li></ul>


<p>I will show the homeTemplate right here, just to give you an idea of what it&rsquo;s like to edit the themes.</p>


<p><img src="/images/blog_theme5_small.jpg" alt="Blog_theme5"  border="0"  /></p>


<p>Most of this is standard XHTML, however you&rsquo;ll notice the macro tags marked with &lt;% %&gt;.&nbsp; These will be picked up by the renderer and replaced with whatever the macro calls for.&nbsp; For example, to tell dasBlog to output your administration bar at a certain location, you&rsquo;d write <strong>&lt;% newtelliigence.adminBar()%&gt;.</strong></p>


<p>For a complete list of dasBlog macros, check John Forsythe&rsquo;s page on macros:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.jforsythe.com/jforsythe/projects/dasBlogMacros.html">http://www.jforsythe.com/jforsythe/projects/dasBlogMacros.html</a></p>


<p>That&rsquo;s enough of an introduction to get you started, so&hellip;.</p>


<h2>Good Luck!</h2>

      <p class="meta">




<time datetime="2007-06-28 00:00:00 -0500" pubdate  updated >Jun 28<span>th</span>, 2007</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m sure that most of my readers are the &ldquo;Family IT&rdquo; people&nbsp;to their relatives.&nbsp; You know, the kind of person that gets regular phone calls from parents, aunts, uncles, cousins, brothers, sisters, grandparents, kids, etc.</p>


<p>I have filled that role since I was probably 13.&nbsp; Most of the time I would just get annoyed, but now, in my infinite maturity (<img src="/images/smile1_______________________.gif"   />), I have fully accepted this responsibility.&nbsp; Here are the 10 steps you (and I) should take to win the <strong>Family IT Guy</strong> award&hellip;&nbsp; come on, you know you want it!</p>


<div style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><p><img src="/images/family_it_guy.gif" alt="Family_it_guy"  border="0"  /></p></div>


<p><strong>Step 1:&nbsp; Get a Good Backup Strategy</strong></p>


<p>It starts with a backup strategy.&nbsp; I have a 500GB Western Digital My Book that takes images of my home PCs and stores them.&nbsp; This pretty much works, except when my house burns down I have nothing.&nbsp; My wife has about 45 GB worth of family photos and digital scrapbooking material.&nbsp; It would be catastrophic to lose all that stuff.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s irreplaceable.&nbsp; Other data that is important to backup are digital scans of driver&rsquo;s licenses, social security cards, birth certificates, tax forms, etc.</p>


<p>So I setup both of our computers (mine and my wife&rsquo;s) on Carbonite online backup.&nbsp; Carbonite installs a little background process that will backup your files behind the scenes.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s less than $50/year and you can store <strong>unlimited</strong> data.&nbsp; Your data is encrypted and uploaded and you can pull it down at any time.</p>


<p>It also installs a little explorer overlay icon that shows you a blue, green, or yellow dot.&nbsp; Green means backed up, so your family knows they&rsquo;re safe.</p>


<p><strong>Step 2:&nbsp; Keep Spare Parts Around</strong></p>


<p>I can&rsquo;t begin to count how many times a family member has asked me for a network cable, or a sound card, or a network card, or just about any other piece of hardware that a computer needs.&nbsp; Since I do a lot of&nbsp;tinkering with computer hardware, I tend to have a lot of spare parts.</p>


<p>Your uncle will appreciate not having to order a new sound card for $15 at the local computer shop or (gasp!) online at&nbsp;<a href="http://newegg.com/" target="_blank">newegg</a>.</p>


<p><strong>Step 3:&nbsp; Keep a Digital Toolbelt on you &ndash; A 2GB USB&nbsp;Drive</strong></p>


<p>I have a copy of&nbsp;every tool from <a href="http://sysinternals.com/" target="_blank">SysInternals</a> on my&nbsp;USB&nbsp;Key.&nbsp;They are invaluable when digging deep into Windows problems.</p>


<p>I also put <a href="http://portableapps.com/" target="_blank">portable apps</a> such as <a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable" target="_blank">Firefox Portable</a> my thumb drive.&nbsp; This allows me to run a better browser when nothing but IE 6 is installed.</p>


<p>Also grab a copy of <a href="http://portableapps.com/apps/utilities/clamwin_portable" target="_blank">ClamWin Antivirus Portable</a><font color="#0066cc"> </font>(or <a href="http://www.clamwin.com/" target="_blank">regular version</a>)&nbsp;or another free AV program.&nbsp; You never know when you&rsquo;ll have a cousin jump out of the bushes and ask you to clean their laptop.</p>


<p>Keeping a thumb drive on you will make it a lot easier to use a family member&rsquo;s computer.&nbsp; The last thing you want to do is <em>have to come back later</em> with the right tools!</p>


<p><em>For a good list of essential tools, check out <a href="http://computerzen.com/tools" target="_blank">Scott Hanselman&rsquo;s Ultimate Tools List</a>.</em></p>


<p><strong>Step 4:&nbsp; Setup Family Email</strong></p>


<p>We&rsquo;re all tired of email addresses like <a href="mailto:JRod44222354@aol.com">JRod44222354@aol.com</a>. (Apologies if that is your email address.)&nbsp; I recently setup <strong>scheirman.com</strong> as my family domain name and gave most of my relatives their own email address.&nbsp; Most of them were pretty excited to have a <a href="mailto:firstname@lastname.com">firstname@lastname.com</a> email address.&nbsp; Of course if your last name is Smith, then you&rsquo;ll have to get creative.</p>


<p>To host the email I&rsquo;m using Google Apps for Your Domain and it works like a charm.&nbsp; Not only do you get all the goodness of GMail, but you get a personal email address as well!&nbsp; Their interface is slick and easy to use.</p>


<p><strong>Step 5:&nbsp; Advise on New Computer Purchases</strong></p>


<p>Don&rsquo;t let your Grandmother buy that new computer from the neigbor kid down the street.&nbsp; If you see your cousin walk into the Sony Style store at the mall with an armload of cash, <strong>stop her</strong>.&nbsp; </p>


<p>Computers are cheap.&nbsp; Unless you want a high-end gaming rig or a video processing machine, your standard Dell fare will do you just fine, and often times under $600.&nbsp; It comes with a warranty, which saves you a headache for at least a year <img src="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/smile1.gif" />.</p>


<p><strong>Step 6:&nbsp; Get a Remote Access Plan</strong></p>


<p>When your sister calls you from Montana and says she needs help adding a user to her computer, be ready.&nbsp; With some good remote access software it can be painless to just take control and do it for her.</p>


<p><a href="http://copilot.com/" target="_blank">FogCreek Copilot</a> is supposed to be good.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/" target="_blank">Joel Spolsky</a><font color="#0066cc">&rsquo;s</font> company <a href="http://www.fogcreeksoftware.com/" target="_blank">Fog Creek Software</a> wrote it and I have heard good reviews.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very cheap for about an hour of use and <em>&ldquo;it just works.&rdquo;</em></p>


<p><img src="/images/crossloop_screenshot_small.jpg" alt="Crossloop_screenshot_small"  border="0"  /></p>


<p>CrossLoop is a tool I just tried out the other day, and it also &ldquo;just works.&rdquo;&nbsp; You and your relative can download this in less than a minute, run it, and be connected even behind firewalls.&nbsp; Best of all, it&rsquo;s free!</p>


<p>I used this the other day when I was helping my wife upload some files to her blog with an FTP client.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t have much time and it was a bit difficult to explain over the phone, so I told her to download the client, click &ldquo;Host&rdquo;&nbsp;and then read me the number on the screen.&nbsp; </p>


<p>That&rsquo;s all it took!</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p><strong>Step 7:&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t Get Annoyed</strong></p>


<p>PC Enthusiasts frequently whine and moan about having to help their relatives about how to use the computer.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s easy for us because we use it everyday.&nbsp; Many non-techies perceive computer gurus like they do auto mechanics or lawyers.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t want this kind of image!</p>


<p>The next time you walk up to your computer, take a look at how many buttons there are.&nbsp; What if your Grandmother sat down for the first time to use a PC?&nbsp; It is incredibly intimidating and complicated.&nbsp; How did <em>you</em> react when you first got a virus?&nbsp; </p>


<p>Cut your family some slack.&nbsp; <strong>Be Patient</strong>.</p>


<p><strong>Step 8:&nbsp; Spread the word.&nbsp; </strong></p>


<p>Get your peeps using Firefox instead of Internet Explorer.&nbsp; Tell them the wonders of GMail.&nbsp; Explain to them that there&rsquo;s more than the MSN home page.&nbsp; Getting the word out is the only way you can ever expect people to <em>see the light</em>.</p>


<p>When someone forwards you an email with a taseless joke or a reason why you should thank the heavens for waking up in the morning, only in ALL CAPS&hellip; politely inform them of internet etiquette.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t just push the SPAM button.</p>


<p>I bought my dad a copy of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lifehacker-Tech-Tricks-Turbocharge-Your/dp/0470050659" target="_blank">Lifehacker book</a> for Christmas last year.&nbsp; He lov
ed it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s full of useful tools and tricks to make your computer work for you.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a computer guy, mind you&hellip; but not the typical person who would read <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/">www.lifehacker.com</a> on a daily basis (though now he proabably does).</p>


<p><strong>Step 9:&nbsp; Find a Protogé</strong></p>


<p>You can&rsquo;t do this stuff forever.&nbsp; Look at the younger folks in your family that can help take the throne.&nbsp; Tell them, &ldquo;One day&hellip;.&nbsp; this will all be yours&hellip;&rdquo;</p>


<p>Be a mentor about good computer usage and troubleshooting.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be stingy with The Badge.&nbsp; Pass it on.</p>


<p><strong>Step 10:&nbsp; Let Your Family Know Your Other Interests</strong></p>


<p>I enjoy playing guitar, swimming, grilling food with family, playing board games, reading books, watching movies and addicting TV shows.&nbsp; If all you talk about is World of Warcraft, <strong>people are going to think you are weird</strong>.&nbsp; Let your family know that you are at least a tad normal, and that you do enjoy sunlight once in a while.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>So there you have it, there are my 10 steps to becoming a good Family IT Guy.&nbsp; A lot of my Family IT Guy inspiration comes from <a href="http://computerzen.com/" target="_blank">Scott Hanselman</a>, who seems to have all this down pretty darn good.&nbsp; I hope his family knows how good they have it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been running Vista for about&nbsp;6 months now, and I really like it.&nbsp; There are a lot of issues that I have run into, but some of the minor ones are easy to fix.</p>


<p>For example, I downloaded <a href="http://e-texteditor.com/" target="_blank">e-texteditor</a>&nbsp;which is like TextMate for Windows.&nbsp; It uses Cygwin for some advanced features, so when you try to use then (like Alt-Shift-Comma for auto-wrapping html brackets and closing tags on a word) &mdash; E goes to install <a href="http://cygwin.com/" target="_blank">Cygwin</a>.&nbsp; Under Vista, clicking on &ldquo;Install&rdquo; does nothing.</p>

<p>The solution is to Run as Administrator.&nbsp; A lot of programs out there aren&rsquo;t testing on Vista so they don&rsquo;t realize that many of the features require elevated access, and if they silently suppress the issue, the user never knows what&rsquo;s going wrong.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the fault of the application, not Vista.</p>


<p>SQL Management Studio Express does this to me as well.&nbsp; I always have to run that program as Administrator.</p>

<p>Check out the New Project dialog box.&nbsp; This is with VSTS Developer,&nbsp;and DB Pro installed:</p>

<p>Seeing as how I never used the standard database project in Visual Studio before, I couldn&rsquo;t tell which one I was supposed to choose.&nbsp; </p>


<p>It turns out that you need to pick the one in the 2<sup>nd</sup> screenshot, the Microsoft SQL Server project.&nbsp; </p>


<p>Wasn&rsquo;t very intuitive which project to choose.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was working on some <a href="http://subsonicproject.com/" target="_blank">SubSonic</a> entities today and I wanted to access some of the properties of the generated classes, not knowing which database objects will exist.</p>


<p>Basically&nbsp;I wanted to write a utility method that would pull out all of the ActiveRecord&lt;T&gt; types in a given assembly.</p>


<p>This was my first attempt:</p>


<p>`
<div><figure role=code><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>public static Type[] GetActiveRecordTypes(Assembly assembly){    List&lt;Type&gt; types = new List&lt;Type&gt;();    foreach (Type type in assembly.GetTypes())  {       if(type.IsSubClassOf( &lt;b>typeof(ActiveRecord&lt;__WHAT_GOES_HERE_?__&gt;)&lt;/b> )           types.Add(type);    }   return types.ToArray();}</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>
`<p>The part in bold is where I got stuck. Sticking in `type` there doesn&#8217;t work. It won&#8217;t compile.&nbsp; I wouldn&#8217;t let that stop me, so I created a temporary solution like this:</p><p>`if(type.BaseType.Name.Contains(&#8220;ActiveRecord&#8221;)) { &#8230; }`</p><p>This works, but it&#8217;s a hack and it&#8217;s brittle. I asked a few friends and <a href="http://analog-man.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Gary DeReese</a> came to my rescue with the following code:</p><p>`
<div><figure role=code><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>Type baseType = type.BaseType;if(baseType.IsGenericType &amp;&amp;   baseType.GetGenericType() == typeof(ActiveRecord&lt;&gt;) &amp;&amp;    baseType.GetGenericParameter()[0] == type) { ... }</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>
`<p></p><p>It&#8217;s good to have smart friends you can reach out to in times like this where you just aren&#8217;t thinking about the problem the way the framework wants you to. Thanks Gary! </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After talking to developers for a few days about basic HTML and ASP.NET topics, I find that I always focus on the <strong>Label</strong> control.</p>


<p>More specifically, I&rsquo;m talking about the `&lt;label&gt;` tag in HTML.&nbsp; What does this tag do?&nbsp; Why should we care, when we can just write the text before an input control on the page?</p>


<p>For starters, the label has semantic meaning.&nbsp; The `&lt;label&gt;` tag gives meaning to a textbox or a dropdown.&nbsp; If you were blind and browsing using a screen reader, you&rsquo;d appreciate the little semantic tidbits that give you an easier browser experience.</p>


<p>Another benefit is that we can select and style the label easily, making the transition to table-less forms so much easier.</p>


<p>A third and possibly more useful benefit is that the mouse stays as a pointer, and clicking on the text sets the focus to the corresponding control.</p>


<p>The usage in standard HTML is like this:</p>


<p>`
<div><figure role=code><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>&lt;label for='user_name'&gt;User Name:&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type='text' id='user_name' /&gt;</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>
`<p></p>This results in the following example: <p><label for="'user_name'">User Name:</label> <input id="'user_name'" type="'text'"> </p><p>(notice how the mouse cursor stays as a pointer, instead of the standard text cursor)</p><p>If you were a reasonable person, you&rsquo;d think that the `&lt;asp:label&gt;` control would render as an HTML `&lt;label&gt;`, but you&rsquo;d be wrong.&nbsp; ASP.NET renders a standard `&lt;asp:label&gt;` as a `&lt;span&gt;`.&nbsp; ASP.NET 2.0 fixed this, however you have to specify the `AssociatedControlID` property to change the rendering behavior.</p><p>This leads me to another point that I&rsquo;d like to make with the <strong>Label</strong> control.&nbsp; Often times we just want a static label, like in the example above.&nbsp; If we use the &lt;asp:label&gt; then we&rsquo;ll have a server-side component as well and a viewstate hit.</p><p><a href="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/label_render.JPG"><img src="/images/label_render_thumb.jpg" alt="Label_render"  border="0"  /></a></p><p>We certainly don&rsquo;t need viewstate in this scenario,&nbsp; Often times we just neglect these things until they are a problem.&nbsp; </p><p>I can hear you say it now&hellip; &ldquo;but Ben, you can disable Viewstate by specifying EnableViewState=&rsquo;false&rsquo; &ldquo;&hellip;&nbsp; I know you can.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s too easy to just leave it as is.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s also an easy alternative.</p><p>You can accomplish the same rendering without the viewstate issue by just typing this:</p><p>`&lt;label for=&#8217;&lt;%= txtUsername.ClientID %&gt;&#8217;&gt;User Name:&lt;/label&gt;`</p><p>This will render the same way, but also ensure that we get the generated ID of the control that we are associating with.&nbsp; This will not have any server-side component or any correlation to ViewState, and it is actually less characters to type.</p><p>Hope you find this information useful!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last night I gave a talk to the largets crowd I have ever spoken in front of.&nbsp; There were over 100 people in the room and they were a great audience.&nbsp; I received lots of devoted attention and people were eager to participate.&nbsp; I was quite nervous in the beginning, but once I got into the material I think it came across very well.</p>


<p>I spoke about why to use CSS and what we can do to overcome some of the pitfalls.&nbsp; I also explained why we don’t want to be using tables for layout.&nbsp; </p>


<p>I moved from there to some javascript techniques and a little bit of ajax.&nbsp; From what I got from that portion, it could have probably warranted more time, but there was just so much to cover.</p>


<p>The files that I used during the demo are available for download here:</p>


<p><a href="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/AdvancedCSSAndJavascript.zip" target="_blank">File Attachment: AdvancedCSSAndJavascript.zip (1140 KB)</a></p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>I received a number of questions about the tools I was using during the demo.&nbsp; The text editor I was using was <strong>e</strong>.&nbsp; You can download it at <a href="http://www.e-texteditor.com/">www.e-texteditor.com</a>.&nbsp; The application launcher that I use is <strong>launchy</strong>.&nbsp; It is available at <a href="http://www.launchy.net/">www.launchy.net</a>.&nbsp; Finally the Keyboard shortcut window, called <strong>Key Jedi</strong> is available <a title="Roy Osherove's blog" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/archive/2007/06/03/train-to-be-a-keyboard-master-with-keyboard-jedi.aspx" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So I went out and installed <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/download/" target="_blank">Safari 3 for Windows</a> yesterday.</p>


<p>I just had to see what all the fuss was about.&nbsp; How do you piss off a number of Windows users simultaneously?&nbsp; Release a product that has a different font rendering technology than their native OS.</p>


<p>Seriously, people are going nuts about this font thing.&nbsp; <a href="http://joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/06/12.html" target="_blank">Joel Spolsky</a> and <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000884.html" target="_blank">Jeff Atwood</a> have covered the details nicely, but I find it quite interesting that something so trivial&nbsp;can make such an impact.&nbsp; You generally don&rsquo;t even think about it, but I&rsquo;ve always noticed that Safari on Mac looked somehow different than Firefox on Windows.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not talking about the browser itself, I&rsquo;m talking about the pages that get rendered.</p>


<p>I can see everyones argument, but I really happen to like the Apple mentality, and as Atwood says, <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000885.html" target="_blank">this debate will be gone once higher dpi screens become available</a>.</p>


<p>There is just something beautiful about the way that plain text looks with Safari, particularly at large sizes.&nbsp; At tiny sizes, however, I get a headache reading it.</p>


<p>Firefox is still my browser-o-choice, but Safari does give me a nice experience.&nbsp; I hope more Mac software ends up on Windows.&nbsp; Choice is good.</p>
