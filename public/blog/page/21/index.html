  <div class="entry-content"><p><font>The collective jaws were dropped at ALT.NET.&nbsp; Just about everyone attended this talk by Scott Guthrie.&nbsp; If you’d like to watch this, Scott Hanselman has recorded the video and posted on his blog.</font></p>


<p><font><img src="/images/ScottGu_2DMVC_small.jpg" alt="ScottGu-MVC"  border="0" /></font></p>


<p><font>Rather than regurgitate it all here, I’ll quickly summarize what it’s like.</font></p>


<p><font>Remember HTML?&nbsp; Yeah, that.&nbsp; We are going back to our roots and back to the model that the web really lives in, not a psuedo, event-driven state-based model that is ASP.NET Web Forms.</font></p>


<p><font>Why don’t we like ASP.NET Web Forms?&nbsp; I do like it, but it does have it’s problems.&nbsp; The benefits of ASP.NET often cause other concerns to rise up.&nbsp; Tired up re-populating data on the form?&nbsp; Here’s some Viewstate for you.&nbsp; Of course Viewstate causes page sizes to explode because most people just leave it on, even for read-only pages with no post-backs.&nbsp; Think of a grid that you place on a page.&nbsp; If you don’t have to postback to the same page again (like with a command field or something) then you can turn viewstate off and have a savings of almost 2X!&nbsp; I for one think that ViewState <em>can</em> be awesome, but it is more likely abused than leveraged.&nbsp; This is a pain point for many people.</font></p>


<p><font>The entire postback model, combined with the event-driven model is something that I have had to learn in-depth the hard way.&nbsp; I really don’t think any of that knowledge is really helpful at all outside of ASP.NET.&nbsp; I spent a crapload of time trying to get server controls to work in the complicated ASP.NET lifecycle, and does that knowledge transfer?&nbsp; Probably not.</font></p>


<p><font>Lastly I think that ASP.NET’s templated control syntax often requires an equal or even more lines of code than the actual HTML would take in the first place!&nbsp; Take the GridView for example.&nbsp; Sure it’s great and it lets you bind data and get columns autogenerated for you, but take a look of that list of properties.&nbsp; There is so much there that you almost need a degree in GridViews to be effective with it.</font></p>


<p><font>Microsoft has been paying attention to the community.&nbsp; We’ve been readily ditching ASP.NET Web Forms in favor or Ruby on Rails or MonoRail.</font></p>


<p><font>ScottGu presented the new MVC framework (codenamed <em>Scalene</em>) to a huge audience.&nbsp; There was a lot of trash talking (in a good way) between ScottGu and Scott Bellware.&nbsp; It’s not easy to take blundt criticism from people like ScottB, but The Gu took it incredibly well and even dished it out a bit.</font></p>


<p><font>What I really liked about ASP.NET MVC is that there isn’t that much to it.&nbsp; Here’s what you’d need to do to start using it on your project (exisitng or new):</font></p>


<ul><li><font>Add the System.Web.MVC.dll (or however it will be packaged — no installer exists yet)</font></li><li><font>Add 1 HttpHandler to handle a new extension</font></li><li><font>Add 1 HttpModule, which provides all of the routing and black magic of MVC</font></li></ul>


<p><font>Create a controller class, like this:</font></p>


<div style="background: rgb(244, 244, 244) none repeat scroll 0%; font-size: 16pt; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; color: black; font-family: Consolas;"><p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: green;">//This example is for you, Jacob Lewallen :)</span></p><p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: blue;">public</span> <span style="color: blue;">class</span> <span style="color: rgb(43, 145, 175);">ClownsController</span> : <span style="color: rgb(43, 145, 175);">Controller</span></p><p style="margin: 0px;">{</p><p style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [<span style="color: rgb(43, 145, 175);">ControllerAction</span>(DefaultAction = <span style="color: blue;">true</span>)]</p><p style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue;">public</span> <span style="color: blue;">void</span> List()</p><p style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {</p><p style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ViewData = <span style="color: rgb(43, 145, 175);">Clown</span>.FindAll();&nbsp; <span style="color: green;">//you write this method or use Castle ActiveRecord for example</span></p><p style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RenderView(<span style="color: rgb(163, 21, 21);">&#8220;List&#8221;</span><font color="#a31515">);</font></p><p style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</p><p style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: blue;">public</span> <span style="color: blue;">void</span> SomethingSecret()</p><p style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {</p><p style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: green;">//this cannot be accessed by a url&nbsp;<br></span><span style="color: green;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//because it doesn&#8217;t have the attribute</span></p><p style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</p><p style="margin: 0px;">}</p></div>

<p>Next you’ll need a view.&nbsp; You can use<font> aspx, Brail, or NVelocity as your templating language.&nbsp; That’s freaking great that you can choose.</font></p>


<p><font>Here’s a quick example of an aspx view:</font></p>

<p>Notice how I <em>get</em>&nbsp;to use standard HTML constructs, use code blocks to provide view functionality &amp; data, and I don’t have to mess with postback or viewstate at all because I don’t need it.&nbsp; </p>


<p><strong>Wait, you mean we have to learn HTML again?</strong>&nbsp; D.H.H. often reminds us that the HTML is provides beautiful constraints that he is happy to work inside of.&nbsp; We don’t have any naming containers here.&nbsp; In fact, we don’t have any unnecessary id elements at all!&nbsp; If we did, they would be <em>exactly</em> what we typed here, making javascript integration a lot easier.</p>


<p>To wrap this all up, a customizable route in the Global.asax will map the following url to render this page:</p>


<p><a href="http://your_url/clowns/list">http://your_url/clowns/list</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;—&nbsp; look how clean!</p>


<p>The framework knows how that the format is <a href="http://your_url/%5Bcontroller%5D/%5Baction%5D">http://your_url/[controller]/[action]</a> and so it instantiates your ClownsController and looks for an action called List().</p>


<p>So much more to talk about, but I’ll&nbsp;be posting more details once I get my hands on it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Wow.&nbsp; What an awesome event.</p>


<p>I’ll skip the play-by-play, because that has been covered to death.&nbsp; Instead I’ll focus on my notes.&nbsp; There are definitely some “meaty” posts in my mind that are still storming, so expect good things to come.&nbsp; There are some good points here, but it’s a long post so I’ll be surprised if I get any comments <img src="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/smile1.gif">.</p>


<h3>Being a Catalyst for Change</h3>


<p>I first attended a session on “Fostering Passion” and “Being a catalyst for change” which were grouped together.&nbsp; A lot of people showed up and <a href="http://www.jpboodhoo.com/" target="_blank">J.P. Boodhoo</a> led us off.&nbsp; He talked about the importance of a good, healthy work attitude, and if you aren’t getting what you need from your current employer then you should really seek out something better.&nbsp; </p>


<ul><li>You need to show pain before you can start evangelizing new stuff.&nbsp; Ask people the question “How is that working for you?”&nbsp; or “What would you want to improve first…. why?”&nbsp; This gives you the context and the opening for suggesting new ideas.</li><li>Talk about problems in context with the 4 variables, this helps lead to whether something is “working” or not</li><ul><li>Time</li><li>Scope</li><li>Quality</li><li>Budget</li></ul><li>Hosting brown-bag sessions is a great way to get people excited.&nbsp; <a href="http://computerzen.com/" target="_blank">Scott Hanselman</a> pointed out that he found it valuable to create a “shadow government” of peers who you can individually get excited about different topics.&nbsp; Ask them to give&nbsp;a lunch &amp; learn and spread the word that way.&nbsp; Somebody called them “Hanselminions”&nbsp; —&nbsp; <em>epic</em>.</li><li>JP Boodhoo stressed that we build relationships before we offer to “fix up their processes.”&nbsp; If you come in wanting to change everything you’ll just alienate your team and ruin your credibility.</li><li>Another thing that we discussed is that newcomer’s to our community are going to be very overwhelmed…&nbsp; currently there isn’t much direction.&nbsp; We don’t want to be prescriptive, but a general “go in that direction” will definitely be helpful.</li></ul>


<h3>Advanced NHibernate</h3>


<p>The next session I attended was Advanced NHibernate Techniques, facilitated by <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeffrey.palermo" target="_blank">Jeffrey Palermo</a>.&nbsp; I found this to be awesome, because usually when I get to talk (or listen) to NHibernate at a user group or code camp, it’s focused on the beginner side of it.&nbsp; Everyone in the room had been using it for a while, and had some really good suggestions and valid problems with it.</p>


<ul><li>ActiveRecord vs. Persistant Ignorant?</li><ul><li>I suggested that for dead-simple models, or a team that doesn’t know DDD, that AR was a much easier path with less friction, however you do quickly hit a limit here when you want to start using more Domain Driven Design such as the Aggregate root/aggregate relationship, repository pattern…&nbsp; or if you need these to be remote… they can’t be used on the client side.&nbsp; Somebody pointed out that it is very difficult to switch from one to the other, and this makes the initial decision very hard.</li><li>Howard Dierking pointed out that “No Simple CRUD app stays that way”</li></ul><li>Database, Mapping, Code -&gt; which first?</li><ul><li>This was basically a poll question.&nbsp; Almost everybody here started with code, then database, then mapping.&nbsp; Very few people used hbm2ddl (like I do) to generate the database.&nbsp; We all agreed that generating the database needs to be abandoned once you start doing tuning and specific tweaks.&nbsp; The <a href="http://blog.eleutian.com/" target="_blank">Eleutian</a> guys (who have names, by the way… Aaron and Jacob) have a pretty hefty process that all starts with a modeling tool.&nbsp; It kind of scares me, but they seem to have it working so that they don’t have to re-work anything.&nbsp; To be truly DRY you definitely need another abstraction, however I’m not convinced that UML is it.&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>What if we had a Boo DSL that represented the mapping, and we could specify advanced DDD concepts there, and have it generate the code, hbm, and Database…</strong>?</li></ul><li>Issues?</li><ul><li>Aaron and Jacob have been stressing about Adaptive Queries and Read-only queries, and I need to make an effort to understand their problem.&nbsp; Originally I dismissed this as a non-issue, but that’s a cop-out.&nbsp; I want to understand what they are wanting that they aren’t getting with NHibernate.</li><li>We all seemed to agree that it’s painful that if you have a single error in your mapping file, the session factory throws an exception and just about every test in your application will fail.&nbsp; This SUCKS for pinpointing the error.&nbsp; I heard <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/howard_dierking" target="_blank">Howard</a> mention something about jitting the mapping assemblies (I guess while writing?) — I definitely need to continue this discussion with him.</li><li>Partials mappings would be pretty cool, so you could generate the mappings based on default conventions, then you could override when necessary.</li></ul></ul>


<h3>ASP.NET MVC Framework presented by <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu" target="_blank">Scott Guthrie</a></h3>


<ul><li>This flippin’ rocks.&nbsp; A detailed post to follow.</li></ul>


<h3>Domain Driven Design – Facilitated by <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/david_laribee/" target="_blank">Dave Laribee</a> and <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/scott.bellware/" target="_blank">Scott Bellware</a> (with a cameo from yours truly!)</h3>


<ul><li>This was pretty much review for me, but it’s always good to get refreshed.</li><li>Opening your mouth is a good way to get people to ask you another question (provided you didn’t say something completely stupid) — I kept getting asked to explain more topics here, which was flattering.</li><li>At one point I said “If you haven’t read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215" target="_blank">Evans</a> yet, go TODAY and buy his book.&nbsp; Then read it 8 times.”&nbsp; — This led people to believe that I had read it a few times.&nbsp; Nope!&nbsp; I still have 7 more to go <img src="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/smile1.gif">.</li><li>A lot of discussion went around the different between responsibilities of the entities, and the responsibilities of domain services (not to be confused with application services or &lt;gasp&gt; SOA).</li></ul>


<h3>User Stories (facilitated by Scott Bellware &amp; <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/raymond.lewallen/" target="_blank">Raymond Lewallen</a>)</h3>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://subsonicproject.com">SubSonic</a>, a dead-simple code-generator / ActiveRecord ORM tool, is about to release a kick-ass new feature.&nbsp; Migrations are an awesome tool that exists in Rails, but we haven&#8217;t had a solid .NET equivalent yet.&nbsp; I hope that SubSonic Migrations will live up to the hype.<br><br>I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.flux88.com/DatabaseMigrationsForNET.aspx">blogged about the need for this before</a>.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been wanting to use VSTS DB Pro in this way, but the tool just isn&#8217;t meant to provide evolutionary db support.<br><br>My current project relies on SubSonic for the code-generation, but our database development is done through DB Pro.&nbsp; I think this is a great tool, but I fear that it&#8217;s really missing something.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure the next version will be much better, as is generally true with Microsoft products.&nbsp; 1st versions often take some time to meld, get some good feedback from the general public, and get the usage stories streamlined.<br><br>I may be able to take advantage of Migrations, however the DB Project needs to contain all scripts (and they have to be named according to the client&#8217;s standards).&nbsp; I wonder if I could create the migrations, execute them, then use sonic.exe to generate the scripts that represent the changes.&nbsp; I could dump this script in the database project (or import it).<br><br>Right now it seems like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg">Rube-Goldbergian</a> mess.&nbsp; Any thoughts, ideas, suggestions?<br><p></p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I hadn&rsquo;t ever gotten around to replacing Notepad with the most-excellent <a href="http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html" target="_blank">Notepad2</a> until today and realized that the method outlined in <a href="http://www.flux88.com/ReplaceNotepadCompletely.aspx">my older post</a> <strong>doesn&rsquo;t</strong> <strong>work in Windows Vista</strong> due to heightened security.</p>


<p>To replace it on Vista, follow these steps:</p>


<ol><li>Download <a href="http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html" target="_blank">Notepad2</a> and put it in a folder somewhere like C:\tools\Notepad2</li><li>In Windows Explorer, navigate to C:\Windows\System32</li><li>Right-click on notepad.exe and go to Properties</li><li>Under the security tab, click Advanced.</li><li>Change the owner to MACHINE\Administrators</li><li>Close and re-open the properties box.</li><li>Go back to the security tab and click &ldquo;Edit&rdquo;</li><li>Give the Administrators group Full Control over the file.</li><li>Now go to a command prompt and type this:<br />copy c:\windows\system32\notepad.exe c:\windows\system32\notepad.exe.old<br />copy c:\tools\notepad2\notepad2.exe c:\windows\system32\notepad.exe</li></ol>


<p>Voila!&nbsp; Now you should be back in business.</p>


<p>Now I&rsquo;m back to wondering why they didn&rsquo;t just make Notepad better in the first place&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Your manager comes to you and says &ldquo;Hey, Joe.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s talk.&nbsp; I&nbsp;need to get a new system developed to keep track of our help desk calls.&nbsp; It needs to have a slick user-interface that is easy to navigate, it needs to be fast, and also we need integration with SAP.&rdquo;&nbsp; You ponder what the system architecture might be like.&nbsp; He continues.&nbsp; &ldquo;So how long do you think this will take?&rdquo;</p>


<p>Of course, your first instinct is to <strong>tell your manager that you&rsquo;ll get back to him later with a rough estimate</strong>, but he is in a hurry and persistent.&nbsp; You cave in and tell him, &ldquo;I think it would take&nbsp;6 weeks.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;Hrm, 6 weeks?&nbsp; I really need it in 5 weeks, no later.&rdquo;</p>


<p><em>Your manager is already negotiating your rough estimate.&nbsp; Be afraid.&nbsp; </em>You start to figure out how you can accomplish all of this in 5 weeks and you are realizing that you really needed <strong><em>eight</em></strong> weeks, not six.&nbsp; Let me put this story on pause while I tell you another story&hellip;</p>


<blockquote><p>Bob is the new night manager at FatBurger.&nbsp; One night a man walks in and requests a double Fat-burger with cheese, a large order of Fat Fries, and a chocolate shake.&nbsp; He pulls out the change in his pocket and Bob finds out that he only has $1.20.&nbsp; The entire meal costs $7.50.</p><p>What would you do in this situation?&nbsp; Turn away your only customer in the 11:00pm hour?&nbsp; Offer something that he <em>can</em> afford?&nbsp; Give it to him for $1.20&nbsp;<em>this time only?</em></p><p>Bob, being a proud night manager, wants to satisfy his customer.&nbsp; He cannot give away the food cheaply because then the guy will return again, expecting another discount.&nbsp; So Bob decides to get creative.&nbsp; He goes around back and finds a dead squirrel on the pavement.&nbsp; He scrapes it up with&nbsp;a shovel and brings it inside, grills it up and gives it to the man.</p></blockquote>


<p>In this story, Bob sacrified quality to give the gentleman what he wanted for only $1.20.</p>


<p>Stop me if this scenario sounds familiar.</p>


<p>Back at your desk, you are realizing that you are about to deliver to your manager a squirrel-burger.&nbsp; He wants X features, but you can&rsquo;t deliver them on time.&nbsp; The first thing you are going to throw out are automated tests.&nbsp; Then you&rsquo;ll stop refactoring.&nbsp; Pretty soon you are just heads-down coding like you did in high school and you are making a huge mess.</p>


<p>Two things are likely to happen.&nbsp; The system will buckle under its own weight because the code reaks of dead squirrels.&nbsp; The other thing that is likely to happen is that your system becomes useful, and now management has another request.</p>


<p>&ldquo;Hey Joe.&nbsp; The new system rocks!&nbsp; I just got off the phone with marketing and they want to start selling this to our larger clients.&rdquo;</p>


<p>Now you&rsquo;re in a pickle.&nbsp; You have a spaghetti-mess of a system and now you need to extend it and polish it for redistribution.&nbsp; </p>


<p>This sad state of affairs is all too common.&nbsp; Your manager might want a double Fat burger with cheese in 5&ndash;weeks, but what he&rsquo;s getting is a squirrel burger.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t deliver squirrel burgers.&nbsp; Be careful with off-the-cuff estimates that end up turning into negotiations.&nbsp; Joe should have negotiated features instead of quality to meet his 5&ndash;week deadline.&nbsp; Estimates should include time for automated tests and refactoring because it is part of your daily coding activity and it helps maintain quality.</p>


<p><em>I first heard the&nbsp;term &ldquo;squirrel burgers&rdquo; and the above story from Mark Pushinsky</em>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Agile Houston tonight was a pretty good turn out. There were over 30 people, so it was a good number to get people talking.&nbsp; If you came, I&rsquo;d love to hear your feedback in the comments!</p>


<p>I was able to talk to a number of agile folks from Houston and it&rsquo;s really cool to see this type of enthusiasm at a local level.</p>


<p>You can download the slides <a href="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/adopting-agile.zip" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>The course was AWESOME and I strongly encourage others to take the course if you are interested in agile/scrum.</p>


<p>Afterwards we took Mark Pushinsky and Kert Peterson out to dinner and shared some stories and laughs.&nbsp; I hope to see these guys again in the future.<br /></p>


<p>(oh yeah, and Jimmy and I worked on something super secretive during our free time on this trip&hellip; more on that later on)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So my buddy Jimmy and I are in Austin right now taking a Certified ScrumMaster course by Mark Pushinksy.&nbsp; </p>


<p>I&rsquo;m ecstatic to be earning this certification, and while I won&rsquo;t be getting a &ldquo;Get out of my way, I&rsquo;m a ScrumMaster&rdquo; T-Shirt, I am getting incredibly valuable, practical Scrum training from two experts.</p>


<p>Excellent Quotes from today:</p>


<blockquote><p>Mark (trainer):&nbsp; So what do you see in the Waterfall model that you don&rsquo;t see in the agile model?<br />Guy: You mean &ldquo;Water<strong>fail</strong>&rdquo; ??</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mark (acting as a troubled PM who hasn&rsquo;t seen any results in 7 months):&nbsp; Well, I need ALL of those features.&nbsp; They are all important.<br />Jeff Palermo:&nbsp; What if I told you that your budget was reduced to 1/10th of what it is now.&nbsp; What would be&nbsp; most important then?<br />Mark:&nbsp; Umm, well all that is important.&nbsp; I need it ALL.<br />Jeff Palermo:&nbsp; Ok, so if I could give you <em>something </em>in 30 days, what would you like to see first?<br />Mark:&nbsp; You can give me something in 30 days?!?!?!</p><p><em>This dialog was very valuable to me.</em></p><p>Mark:&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t heal, what you can&rsquo;t feel.&nbsp; (not going to sell agile if they aren&rsquo;t already feeling pain with current process)</p><p><br />&nbsp;</p></blockquote>


<p>Here are some notable points:</p>


<ul><li>If you tell a customer that it&rsquo;s going to take 12&ndash;18 months to deliver his software, what kind of features do you think he&rsquo;s going to ask for?&nbsp; He&rsquo;s going to think &ldquo;Well if I&rsquo;m not going to get it for over a year, I better get the everything and the kitchen sink!&rdquo;&nbsp; Contrast this with telling the customer that you can deliver in 30 days, what is most important?</li><li>Scrum demands transparency on the project.&nbsp; Why would some people resist this?&nbsp; Lack of trust, Fear of failure (or appearing as a failure).</li><li>Shu, Ha, Ri (martial arts terms &mdash; Learning the Rules, Applying the Rules, Adapting and Combining the Rules)</li><li>Waterfall separation of analyst, architects, developers, testers breeds lack of trust.&nbsp; In the extremem these groups become &ldquo;enemies&rdquo; &mdash; Ever heard &ldquo; Oh if we ever got good requirements we could deliver&rdquo;&nbsp; &mdash; or &ldquo;the developers are delivering tons of bugs to us!&nbsp; What are they doing?!?!&rdquo;</li><li>Agile/Iterative teams self-organize and fill needed roles to meet the sprint goal&nbsp;&ndash; this <em>fosters </em>trust between team members</li><li>The class had some trinkets and creativity toys which I thought was a nice touch to break the monotony of sitting in the same place for a long time</li><li>There were many hands on activities, many requiring us to stand up.&nbsp; These were awesome!</li><li>Think of scrum as a snowman.&nbsp; The head is the daily activity (24 hrs), the middle section is the sprint (2&ndash;4 weeks) and the base is the release plan (3&ndash;6 months)</li><li>Don&rsquo;t make squirrel burgers (don&rsquo;t deliver software that is low quality.&nbsp; Low quality means sloppy code, no unit tests, any corner-cutting.)</li></ul>


<p>Role of Scrum Master</p>


<ul><li>Remove barriers</li><li>Increase transparency</li><li>Help Customer/Product Owner realize ROI by prioritizing product backlog</li><li>Educating those involved about scrum rules</li><li>(Silent) leader / facilitator</li><li>Improving engineering practices to meeting shippable goal at end of sprint</li><li>empower team to&nbsp;make decisions and get stuff done (self organize)</li><li>look for &ldquo;coachable moments&rdquo;</li></ul>


<p>More to come tomorrow&hellip;</p>
