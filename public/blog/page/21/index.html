<p>The course was AWESOME and I strongly encourage others to take the course if you are interested in agile/scrum.</p>


<p>Afterwards we took Mark Pushinsky and Kert Peterson out to dinner and shared some stories and laughs.&nbsp; I hope to see these guys again in the future.<br /></p>


<p>(oh yeah, and Jimmy and I worked on something super secretive during our free time on this trip&hellip; more on that later on)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So my buddy Jimmy and I are in Austin right now taking a Certified ScrumMaster course by Mark Pushinksy.&nbsp; </p>


<p>I&rsquo;m ecstatic to be earning this certification, and while I won&rsquo;t be getting a &ldquo;Get out of my way, I&rsquo;m a ScrumMaster&rdquo; T-Shirt, I am getting incredibly valuable, practical Scrum training from two experts.</p>


<p>Excellent Quotes from today:</p>


<blockquote><p>Mark (trainer):&nbsp; So what do you see in the Waterfall model that you don&rsquo;t see in the agile model?<br />Guy: You mean &ldquo;Water<strong>fail</strong>&rdquo; ??</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mark (acting as a troubled PM who hasn&rsquo;t seen any results in 7 months):&nbsp; Well, I need ALL of those features.&nbsp; They are all important.<br />Jeff Palermo:&nbsp; What if I told you that your budget was reduced to 1/10th of what it is now.&nbsp; What would be&nbsp; most important then?<br />Mark:&nbsp; Umm, well all that is important.&nbsp; I need it ALL.<br />Jeff Palermo:&nbsp; Ok, so if I could give you <em>something </em>in 30 days, what would you like to see first?<br />Mark:&nbsp; You can give me something in 30 days?!?!?!</p><p><em>This dialog was very valuable to me.</em></p><p>Mark:&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t heal, what you can&rsquo;t feel.&nbsp; (not going to sell agile if they aren&rsquo;t already feeling pain with current process)</p><p><br />&nbsp;</p></blockquote>


<p>Here are some notable points:</p>


<ul><li>If you tell a customer that it&rsquo;s going to take 12&ndash;18 months to deliver his software, what kind of features do you think he&rsquo;s going to ask for?&nbsp; He&rsquo;s going to think &ldquo;Well if I&rsquo;m not going to get it for over a year, I better get the everything and the kitchen sink!&rdquo;&nbsp; Contrast this with telling the customer that you can deliver in 30 days, what is most important?</li><li>Scrum demands transparency on the project.&nbsp; Why would some people resist this?&nbsp; Lack of trust, Fear of failure (or appearing as a failure).</li><li>Shu, Ha, Ri (martial arts terms &mdash; Learning the Rules, Applying the Rules, Adapting and Combining the Rules)</li><li>Waterfall separation of analyst, architects, developers, testers breeds lack of trust.&nbsp; In the extremem these groups become &ldquo;enemies&rdquo; &mdash; Ever heard &ldquo; Oh if we ever got good requirements we could deliver&rdquo;&nbsp; &mdash; or &ldquo;the developers are delivering tons of bugs to us!&nbsp; What are they doing?!?!&rdquo;</li><li>Agile/Iterative teams self-organize and fill needed roles to meet the sprint goal&nbsp;&ndash; this <em>fosters </em>trust between team members</li><li>The class had some trinkets and creativity toys which I thought was a nice touch to break the monotony of sitting in the same place for a long time</li><li>There were many hands on activities, many requiring us to stand up.&nbsp; These were awesome!</li><li>Think of scrum as a snowman.&nbsp; The head is the daily activity (24 hrs), the middle section is the sprint (2&ndash;4 weeks) and the base is the release plan (3&ndash;6 months)</li><li>Don&rsquo;t make squirrel burgers (don&rsquo;t deliver software that is low quality.&nbsp; Low quality means sloppy code, no unit tests, any corner-cutting.)</li></ul>


<p>Role of Scrum Master</p>


<ul><li>Remove barriers</li><li>Increase transparency</li><li>Help Customer/Product Owner realize ROI by prioritizing product backlog</li><li>Educating those involved about scrum rules</li><li>(Silent) leader / facilitator</li><li>Improving engineering practices to meeting shippable goal at end of sprint</li><li>empower team to&nbsp;make decisions and get stuff done (self organize)</li><li>look for &ldquo;coachable moments&rdquo;</li></ul>


<p>More to come tomorrow&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ever gone to a site that you found via google that seems to have the EXACT answer to the problem you are looking for?&nbsp; Then you click on the link and you are shown a page that basically says &#8220;You must be a member to access this article.&#8221;<br><br>I can&#8217;t stand sites like this.&nbsp; In addition, they are in clear violation of Google&#8217;s TOS, and they should get dropped from indexing unless the open up the content.&nbsp; <br><br><i>Why are they in violation of Google&#8217;s TOS, you ask?</i>&nbsp; Well basically they are sniffing for googlebot (or any other web crawler) and serving up real content to them.&nbsp; The data gets indexed, the site&#8217;s PageRank goes up and the site starts showing high up in the google search results.&nbsp; But when you or I access the page, we get a different page, telling us that we should pay them money to see the content.<br><br>So if you want to give these sites a big middle finger, go download the <a href="http://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/59">user agent switcher Firefox extension</a>.&nbsp; Then add the googlebot useragent to the list.&nbsp; You can get a huge list of commun useragents <a href="http://techpatterns.com/forums/about304.html">here</a>.<br><br>Now, find a site that blocks articles to non-members, such as this one:<br><br><img src="http://flux88.com/uploads/using-useragent-switcher1.png"><br><br>Change your user agent like so&#8230;.<br><br><img src="http://flux88.com/uploads/using-useragent-switcher2.png"><br><br>And refresh.&nbsp; <font size="-1">Voilà!</font> you&#8217;re in!<br><br><img src="http://flux88.com/uploads/using-useragent-switcher3.png"><br><p></p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am <a href="http://agilehouston.org/Main/AdoptingAgile" target="_blank">going to be speaking on Adopting Agile</a> to our local Agile Houston user group.&nbsp; Our last presenter, Robert Martin was excellent, and the speaker following me (who I shall not yet name for fear of jinxing it) is going to be stellar as well.&nbsp; <em>Maybe if I sandwich myself between great people I can be great by proxy.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll see.</em></p>


<p>Anyway we&rsquo;re not yet sure of the venue (might not be at UH this time), so keep an eye out on the <a href="http://agilehouston.org/" target="_blank">agile houston website</a> for details.&nbsp; The date will either be September 24<sup>th</sup> or 25<sup>th</sup>, but I thought I would announce it now to give ample notice to those of you who are in Houston but don&rsquo;t subscribe to the <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/render?cid=agilehouston.org_8usi44um97qqppr46b8g3383s4%40group.calendar.google.com" target="_blank">Agile Houston calendar</a>.</p>


<p>My talk will cover some of the foundational principles that are deemed &ldquo;agile&rdquo; and why they are valuable.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll also talk about the best way to go about introducing agile at a solo level, a team level, and a company level.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like it to go off as a sort of dialog to get everyone sharing experiences and opinions.</p>


<p>Come check it out next week!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My friend <a href="http://aspadvice.com/blogs/azamsharp/archive/2007/09/12/Business-Logic-in-Stored-Procedure_2100_-Sometimes-Beneficial.aspx">Azam</a> just hit a nerve.&nbsp; One of my pet peeves is the fact that some people clutch to stored procedures and claim it to be the <b>one place to hold the true state and logic of a system</b>.&nbsp; I have worked with such a DBA, and it was not very fun.<br><br>Anyway, he makes the claim that it is easier to make a tiny change to a stored procedure than to make the change in code, recompile, and upload the new version of the application to the servers.&nbsp; He gives this example:<br><br><blockquote><i>Let&#8217;s say that you have some code to display all the users whoenrolled&nbsp;within the past 7 days. You implement it using some OR Mapperand the domain contains the logic for pulling out the users enrolledwithin the past 7 days. Everything worked fine! Now, the client comesand ask you that he needs to view the users enrolled in the past 14days (Let&#8217;s assume for the sake of discussion that we don&#8217;t have the UIto select the number of days). Now, you have to change the code in thedomain model and then upload the new version of the application.</i></blockquote><br><br>I have to disagree.&nbsp; While the impedance to making a change is usually smaller by updating a stored proc, a change is a change is a change.<br><br>Most production enviornments I have worked in are guarded by a machine-gun weilding fairy with a SOX t-shirt on that won&#8217;t let me run an innocent little script without getting the blood of 14 virgins and my manager&#8217;s approval.&nbsp; So sometimes the actual process of making a change overshadows the change itself.<br><br>2nd, when the next developer goes to review the code, shouldn&#8217;t he/she know EXACTLY where the business logic is?&nbsp; I would argue that the largest cost in this scenario is the maintenance cost of the poor developer who doesn&#8217;t know where to look for a change.&nbsp; It could take an entire day of searching to find out exactly where that rule is being defined.<br><br>If the value in question (the number of days) was identified to be a possible changing value, then place it in a config file so that the application can change on the fly without having to jump through burning hoops of fire.<br><br>Anyway, like I said, this is one of my pet peeves, so if you enjoy working with elegant software, don&#8217;t put logic in your database.&nbsp; Keep it in your domain layer where it belongs.<br><p></p></p>

<p>The difference is that the two are mutually exclusive.&nbsp; If you have controls inside the table cell, then the Text property will be empty.&nbsp; If you have the Text property set, then there can&#8217;t be any controls.<br /><br/>So in my case I was setting the Text property, then trying to insert a LinkButton control right <i>before</i> the text.&nbsp; So I diligently put <br/></p>

<div><figure role=code><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>row.Cells[index].Controls.AddAt(0, theLinkButton);</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>


<p>Which happily wipes everything that was previously in the Text property.&nbsp; Ugh.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My heart sank last week.&nbsp; Our dog, Molly, was hit by a car&hellip;</p>


<p>She was chasing after our other dog (a puppy) and crossed a busy road.&nbsp; We got the call and picked her up from a nice gentleman that kept her cool in his car (the Texas heat is around 100&deg; F outside).</p>


<p>She had a nasty laceration on her head and a bunch of scrapes and cuts.&nbsp; Molly had been rolled under a car and obviously suffered a large blow to the head.&nbsp; We rushed her to the Emergency Animal Clinic of Houston and they took her in.&nbsp; There was blood all over my car and my shorts.&nbsp; We were in complete shock.</p>


<p>Until this moment I didn&rsquo;t realize how much Molly really meant to me.&nbsp; She was always a great dog and I loved her, but I didn&rsquo;t take the time to pet her everyday and spend some time with her.&nbsp; My wife and I were pretty shaken up at the thought that she had almost died.</p>


<p>Our children were nearly devastated.&nbsp; None of us could believe that we almost lost her.</p>


<p>Molly was treated with&nbsp;6 staples to her head-wound.&nbsp; We picked her up the next day.</p>

<p><img src="/images/IMG_5825_small.jpg" alt="IMG_5825"  border="0"  /></p>


<p>Her handkercheif reads &ldquo;They saved my life at the Animal Emergency Center of Houston.&rdquo;</p>


<p>She is still a little skiddish, but she has quickly returned to her normal self and we love her.&nbsp; Take the time to hug your dog today.&nbsp; Show them that you appreciate them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m kind of a nut when it comes to nit-pickiness in applications.&nbsp; I have always wanted to use Office Tasks as my todo list, however it was never effective enought to stick with.</p>


<p>The <a href="http://lifehacker.com/" target="_blank">lifehacker</a> recommended todo.txt&nbsp;is as lo-fi you can get before going completely non-tech, but I really don&rsquo;t want to manage a text file.&nbsp; I want the computer to work for me.</p>


<p>I recently discovered todoist.com, a minimalist, but oh-so-flexible todo-list application that really has me using it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s got more umph than the excellent tadalist.com, and this is why it&rsquo;s more useful to me.</p>


<p>Here&rsquo;s a screenshot of my current list.&nbsp; I have top-level projects called <strong>Work, Home, and Leisure</strong> and I drill down from there.</p>


<p><img src="/images/todoist_small.jpg" alt="Todoist"  border="0"  /></p>


<p>Notice how I have recurring tasks in the @Home project.&nbsp; (Also, notice that I didn&rsquo;t mow the lawn or sweep the driveway this weekend.&nbsp; Oops!&nbsp; I guess this goes to show you that no matter how fancy your todo list is implemented, you still actually have to DO stuff to accomplish anything)</p>


<p>I also jot down little notes and things, such as what movies to rent or buy next, or what my reading list looks like.</p>


<p>Todoist has a pretty simple API as well.&nbsp; Everything is token based, so you have a long token that serves as your credentials for making a call.&nbsp; This is similar to the way that google does it.</p>


<p>Speaking of google, todoist integrates with GMail with a simple bookmarklet or firefox plugin.&nbsp; Just open an email within GMail and click the bookmarklet and the email shows up as a task in todoist.</p>


<p>Another awesome feature is the <a href="http://launchy.net/" target="_blank">Launchy</a> plugin.&nbsp; Everyone knows I loves me some Launchy, but now I can type <strong>todo | add &ldquo;get some milk&rdquo; to &ldquo;Shopping&rdquo;</strong> and todoist will pick it up.&nbsp; Slick.</p>


<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m smitten with this tool.&nbsp; What do you use to manage your todolist?&nbsp; If it&rsquo;s not Outlook, then I&rsquo;d like to hear about it in the comments.&nbsp; (If it is Outlook, I suppose you can comment as well, I&rsquo;ll forgive you)</p>
