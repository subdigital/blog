  <div class="entry-content"><p>I <a href="http://flux88.com/blog/teaser-hellip/" target="_blank">previously hinted</a> at an application that I was working on, but wasn’t ready to disclose details.&#160; I have reached a point where I am ready to show what I’ve been working on this past summer.</p>


<p>  <p>The basic idea is this:&#160; <em>Guitar Tablature in your pocket, wherever you are</em>.&#160; </p>  <p>If you don’t know what tablature, check <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablature" target="_blank">this Wikipedia entry</a>.</p>  <h2>Pocket Tabs for iPhone</h2>  <p>Pocket Tabs is an iPhone application that aims to be a guitarists companion.&#160; Often times I’ve found myself with a guitar but not in front of a computer.&#160; I know many songs, but usually I need to look them up to refresh my memory before I can play them again.</p>  <p><a href="http://flux88.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/AnnouncingPocketTabsforiPhone_A15/Finder_2.png" target="_blank"><img src="/images/Finder_thumb.png" alt="Finder"  height="480"  /></a></p>  <p>Pocket Tabs allows you to search for tabs online and view them in a hands-free fashion.&#160; You can even save the tabs to your device so that they’ll be available without an internet connection.&#160; This is perfect for camping, where internet connections are sparse, but guitars are plenty!&#160; It is also useful for iPod Touch owners.&#160; They can load up tabs to their device while they’re on Wi-Fi, and have them ready wherever they are.</p>  <p><a href="http://flux88.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/AnnouncingPocketTabsforiPhone_A15/iPhone%20Simulator%206_2.png"><img src="/images/iPhone%20Simulator%206_thumb.png" alt="iPhone Simulator 6"  height="480"  /></a> </p>  <p><a href="http://flux88.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/AnnouncingPocketTabsforiPhone_A15/iPhone%20Simulator%203_2.png"><img src="/images/iPhone%20Simulator%203_thumb.png" alt="iPhone Simulator 3"  height="480"  /></a> </p>  <p>A cool feature that I’m really proud of is “Auto-Scroll”.&#160; Most of the time you’ll be using both of your hands to play the guitar, so this allows you to scroll at a set speed automatically.</p>  <p><a href="http://flux88.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/AnnouncingPocketTabsforiPhone_A15/iPhone%20Simulator%202_2.png"><img src="/images/iPhone%20Simulator%202_thumb.png" alt="iPhone Simulator 2"  height="480"  /></a> </p>  <p><a href="http://flux88.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/AnnouncingPocketTabsforiPhone_A15/iPhone%20Simulator_4.png"><img src="/images/iPhone%20Simulator_thumb_1.png" alt="iPhone Simulator"  height="480"  /></a> </p>  <h2>Submit Tabs Online!</h2>  <p>Pocket Tabs searches it’s companion website, <a href="http://pockettabs.com">http://pockettabs.com</a> for tablature.&#160; These are user-submitted tabs &amp; chords, so if there isn’t a song you like available, you’re free to submit it at <a href="http://pockettabs.com/submit">http://pockettabs.com/submit</a>.</p>  <h2>I Need Beta Testers</h2>  <p>I’m getting ready to release a beta version, and I need a few beta testers.&#160; So if you play guitar, have an iPhone or iPod Touch, and want to help out, please send an email to beta[AT]pockettabs[DOT]com to express your interest.</p>  <p>I am planning on getting 20-30 beta testers, so get your requests in as soon as possible.&#160; I’ll then send out an email with instructions on how to get started with the beta.</p>  <p>   <p></p>    <p></p>    <p></p>    <p></p>    <p></p>    <p>&#160;</p>    <p>What do you think?&#160; Let me know in the comments!</p></p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I first graduated from college I worked for a small company doing custom development work in .NET 1.1.</p>


<p>Our largest client (coincidentally where our offices were) had a print shop and a web site for financial agents to set up and send mailings to folks inviting them to a dinner and telling them about the latest &amp; greatest annuities that they should invest all their money in.</p>


<p>The system was pretty interesting.&nbsp; With a batch job they&#8217;d print out letters, a bio card that showed the agent&#8217;s photo on it, and other inserts, such as tickets to the dinner.&nbsp; These would be collated, folded, and stuffed into an envelope that would be licked, sealed, and affixed with a real stamp. (<em>People are 20 times more likely to open a letter if it has a real stamp &#8211; and yes I just made that number up</em>).&nbsp; It was very impressive to watch it all work.</p>


<p>The website we built allowed the agents to place these orders (with optional inserts) and mail them to a set of folks matching a given demographic all online.</p>


<p><img style="margin: 10px 10px 10px 0px" align="left" alt="" src="http://www.creative-ps.com/images/content/mailsorter.jpg" /></p>


<p>Often times the agents would purchase an upgrade to have a reminder card sent to each person a week before the event occurred.&nbsp; These cards were special and even though we had a room full of expensive printers, we didn&#8217;t have the ability to print these cards.&nbsp; So we&#8217;d have to outsource it to another print shop across town.</p>


<p>The process went something like this:</p>


<ul>
<li>We&#8217;d compile all the info, along with a TIF of the agent&#8217;s photo and FTP it over to the other company</li>
<li>They&#8217;d print them all and drive them to the post office for mailing</li>
<li>They would charge us money</li>
</ul>


<p>All of this just worked, and I never had to see the internals of this system.&nbsp; That is, until my boss went on vacation to Mexico (at the time it was just me and him).</p>


<p>You see, an agent had sent a card to himself and a couple of his friends.&nbsp; He never received them.&nbsp; Since he had paid of for the upgrade he was understandably upset.&nbsp; They asked me to look into it.</p>


<p>I was slightly familiar with the tables, and so I went looking.&nbsp; There was a table along the lines of ResponseCardQueue.&nbsp; It contained columns such as agent_id, recipient, address, city, state, zip, and date_sent.</p>


<p>There were tens of thousands of these records.&nbsp; I issued this query:</p>




<div><figure role=code><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>SELECT * FROM ResponseCardQueue WHERE date_sent IS NULL</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>




<p>To find that there were about 2100 records returned.&nbsp; For some reason these weren&#8217;t being processed.</p>


<p>I finally found the code that was reading this, and it had some code that looked like this:</p>




<div><figure role=code><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>public void ProcessCards(Card[] cards)&lt;br />{&lt;br />&nbsp; try &lt;br />&nbsp; {&lt;br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; foreach(Card c in cards)&lt;br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {&lt;br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; string tifFilename = @&quot;\\SOME\NETWORK\PATH\&quot; + c.AgentId + &quot;.TIF&quot;&lt;br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //copy details + tif image to some folder&lt;br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }&lt;br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //zip up folder&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; //FTP the file to the other print shop&lt;br />    //mark date_sent to DateTime.now&lt;br />&nbsp; }&lt;br />&nbsp; catch&lt;br />&nbsp; {&lt;br />&nbsp; }&lt;br />}</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>




<p>There are two things to notice.&nbsp; One was that we were calculating the filename based on the column in the database.&nbsp; The 2nd was the empty catch block, effectively allowing errors to go on unnoticed.</p>


<p>In this system an agent id was an identity column in another table, so the numbers were incrementing by 1 with each new account.&nbsp; After much searching, I realized that the column type for the agent id in this table was defined as a char(4).&nbsp; So as soon as we had our 10000th record in the system, it started looking for filenames that didn&#8217;t exist on the network share.</p>


<p>It would be something like this:</p>


<p>agent id 10200 would get truncated to 1020, which in our system didn&#8217;t exist (most of the numbers started in the 4000&#8217;s.&nbsp; So the filename didn&#8217;t exist (and probably better that it errored out here rather than choose the wrong picture for the card!).&nbsp; This code threw an exception and stopped processing future records.</p>


<p>And so the unsent records piled up.&nbsp; For 4 months.</p>


<p><img style="margin: 10px 0px 10px 10px" align="right" width="137" height="174" alt="" src="http://1sdiresource.com/pile.jpg" /></p>


<p>So I diligently made the column type int and updated the records that were below that threshold to correct their agent id numbers.&nbsp; So guess what happened?&nbsp; I fixed the clog and with one big TWOOOSH all of the records were processed.</p>


<p>I felt mighty proud.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>Until&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>A few hours later I realized that the cards would actually now be mailed!&nbsp; How embarrassing it would be to remind someone of an event that took place 3 months ago?</p>


<p>By the time I was able to explain all of this and someone jumped in their car and went to the post office just in time to grab the entire batch before it was about to be mailed.</p>


<p>We still were charged for the printing &amp; postage of those cards, however we saved ourselves the embarrassment of explaining to all of our customers that we screwed up big time.</p>


<p>I learned a valuable lesson that a simple oversight can cost a company a <em>ton</em> of money (and in this case&#8230; reputation).</p>


<p>So what&#8217;s your favorite production software bug?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well the day has arrived.&nbsp; Our book has finally been submitted to print and it should be in stores on September 7th.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m very happy to be finished with the book.&nbsp; I think there are a lot of great books on ASP.NET MVC, yet ours still stands out as it targets a different audience than the other books.</p>


<p>In the book you&rsquo;ll find our (sometimes opinionated) views on application development, architecture, separation of concerns, emphasis on testing, MvcContrib, NHibernate, StructureMap, and more.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll also learn plenty about the extension points of the framework, as we take you through many examples to illustrate the topic.</p>


<p>I&rsquo;m especially proud of the Routing and Ajax chapters, which have received warm reviews during the early PDF drops.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what some folks are saying about the book:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>I really enjoyed ASP.NET MVC in Action and highly recommend it for a fresh look at the ASP.NET MVC Framework.&nbsp; <br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I read a blog post by an unnamed TFS MVP.&nbsp; In the post he claimed that TFS was a big win for small companies and started to outline costs.&nbsp; Roughly he said that with the available pricing options you could get adequate licenses for TFS, VSTS, etc.&nbsp; The figures ranged from $7k to roughly $40k.</p>


<p>My response, which is pasted below, was immediately deleted from his blog.&nbsp; <em>Why</em>?&nbsp; Quoting the email I received:</p>


<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;No offense, but I deleted your comment.&nbsp; I make way too much $$ on Team System training &amp; consulting to go publicly plugging alternative options.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>


<p><strong>WOW.&nbsp; What a complete lack of integrity.&nbsp; </strong></p>


<p><img style="display: inline; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px" align="right" width="319" height="213" alt="" src="http://compoundthinking.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/istock_000002694919xsmall.jpg" /></p>


<p>Rather that look out &amp; learn from the broader software community to see what works well, let&rsquo;s just stick our head in the sand &amp; pretend they don&rsquo;t exist!</p>


<p>If TFS MVPs won&rsquo;t even engage to discuss about the product they spend the majority of their time in, what does that say about the product?</p>


<p>Here was my original comment:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>I can honestly say I don&#8217;t understand how you can feel this way.     <br />
I think if TFS was completely free you&#8217;d still have trouble getting small companies to adopt it.&nbsp; why?&nbsp; Because there are more mature tools available.</p>
<p><br />
Git, SVN are far less friction tools for source control.&nbsp; They are easy to get started, 100% free.&nbsp; (Distributed workers being ever present these days, how long until the TFS team realizes that the central commanding server that locks your files is *not* a good approach to source control?)      <br />
Most people I&#8217;ve talked to don&#8217;t like managing work items within Visual Studio (which has a horrible UX for filling out forms of data &#8211; seriously a dropdown box that is 1600px wide?&nbsp; Gross) and TFS web access is only a small improvement.</p>
<p><br />
Use something like Basecamp, Fogbugz, Unfuddle, whatever.&nbsp; They are very cheap, can integrate with your source control system, and are a joy to use.      <br />
Now let&#8217;s talk continuous integration.&nbsp; TFS is also clearly not a leader here.&nbsp; Hudson, Cruise Control, and Team City (professional) are all free and superior.&nbsp; Team City literally takes a few minutes to set up.&nbsp; And guess what?&nbsp; It automatically picks up source from SVN or Git, and integrates natively with NUnit.&nbsp; MSTest?&nbsp; Nope, you need a hack for that.</p>
<p><br />
Finally let&#8217;s talk unit testing tools.&nbsp; MSTest has always lagged behind the other free testing frameworks.&nbsp; Why wait for the Microsoft mothership to come around and release a new version every couple of years when you can get the benefit of updates that keep up with the ever changing landscape of our profession?</p>
<p><br />
The *only* thing I think TFS has a story for is integration.&nbsp; But when you integrate a bunch of mediocre tools, you get a mediocre solution.      <br />
So give me a $100k budget and I&#8217;ll still choose mostly free tools.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>His full response, name excluded:</p>


<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;Hey, Ben &#8211; long time, no talk.       <br />
Uhhhmmm&#8230;no offense but I deleted your comment.&nbsp; I make way too much $$ from Team System training and consulting to go publicly plugging alternative options.&nbsp; It&#8217;d be like me going to your blog and dumping on your ASP MVC book or NHibernate or something.&nbsp; As a consultant, I think you probably get the idea.        <br />
&lt;grin /&gt;</em></p>
<em>
<p><br />
Anyway, dude, you might be thinking about TFS2005 more than TFS2008.&nbsp; TFS2005 had some &#8211; uhmmm &#8211; &#8216;issues&#8217;.&nbsp; A lot of the issues have been taken care of in 2008.&nbsp; In TFS2008 (and in 2005, although with more difficulty) you can do multiple checkout and there&#8217;s a decent story for offline access, too.&nbsp; There is locking but, in 3 years of working with TFS, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever used it.</p>

On the VSTS work item UI, yah&#8230;I hear ya.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not as pretty as it could be.&nbsp; That&#8217;s part of why I do a lot of my work item (bugs, tasks, etc) editing in Excel, or via TS Web Access.&nbsp; Where are you getting the 1600px wide dropdown box?&nbsp; That&#8217;s just fn awful.&nbsp; There&#8217;s gotta be a way to make that better &#8211; change the UI control or something.</p>
<p><br />
Why isn&#8217;t TFS2008 good at continuous integration?&nbsp; Sure, in TFS2005 it was a hacky mess and you had to use 3rd party extensions (like the one I wrote) but in TFS2008, it works great out of the box.        <br />
You nailed why I like VSTS tho &#8211; the integration.&nbsp; Why would I want to deal with multiple products from multiple vendors when I can deal with just one?&nbsp; For you and me, keeping those disparate servers/apps up and running isn&#8217;t a huge deal but to a lot of organizations, it&#8217;s a big pain in the ass&#8230;at a minimum it&#8217;s a distraction.&nbsp; Sure it&#8217;s free but it&#8217;s a free distraction.&nbsp; (shrug)        <br />
Plus, there&#8217;s the data warehouse on the back-end of TFS.&nbsp; TFS is constantly collecting all the data from your project plan, defects, builds, unit tests within the builds, code coverage within the builds and dumping them into a data warehouse.&nbsp; From there you can get comprehensive, up-to-the-minute (well, by default up-to-the-hour) intelligence about the status of your projects.&nbsp; This helps you to see what&#8217;s going on on your project and (hopefully) expose when you&#8217;re going off the rails.        <br />
Wait &#8216;til VSTS2010 comes out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I think his response is perfectly valid.&nbsp; It opens the door to discuss the points.&nbsp; What frustrates me the most is the unwillingness to engage publicly.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#160;</p>


<p>  <p><img src="/images/iphone-mov_3.png" align="left"  height="519"  /> </p>  <p>On Tuesday (7/14/2009) we had our monthly geek dinner where we get together, have beer &amp; pizza, and talk about technology.&#160; Usually it is centered around .NET, but lately I’ve been doing some development on the iPhone, so I thought I’d give a demo &amp; talk about how it relates to .NET developers.</p>  <p>In the video I talk about:</p>  <ul>   <li>How to use Interface Builder to build the UI visually. </li>    <li>How to hook up IBOutlets and IBActions from the view controller to the view elements in Interface Builder </li>    <li>How to do animation with CoreAnimation </li>    <li>How to create &amp; position views programmatically </li> </ul>  <p>There is also some random discussion about the capabilities on the phone, what the APIs are like for the various features, and how some of this relates to .NET and C#.</p>  <p>Unfortunately I forgot to hit record when I was doing a primer on Objective-C, so if you need that, then I suggest reading <a href="http://cocoadevcentral.com/d/learn_objectivec/" target="_blank">this article</a>.&#160; <em>(In fact, read up all of <a href="http://cocoadevcentral.com/" target="_blank">Cocoa Dev Central</a> because it’s a great resource.)</em></p>  <p>The 2nd demo I did I didn’t immediately give credit to (I did later off camera) but I wanted to make sure that I give credit to the original author, over at <a href="http://appsamuck.com/" target="_blank">AppsAmuck.com</a>.&#160; They have a great series called 31 Days of iPhone.&#160;&#160; The demo I did can be found <a href="http://appsamuck.com/day9.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Here is the video:</p> <object width="400" height="300"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=5642740&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00ADEF&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=5642740&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00ADEF&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="400" height="300"></embed></object>  <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/5642740">Intro to iPhone Development</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user1579700">Ben Scheirman</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>A bunch of people asked me how I learned all of this.&#160; First, I read this book:</p> <iframe style="width: 120px; height: 240px" marginheight="0" src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&amp;bc1=FFFFFF&amp;IS2=1&amp;npa=1&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;fc1=000000&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;t=flux88com-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;m=amazon&amp;f=ifr&amp;md=10FE9736YVPPT7A0FBG2&amp;asins=0321503619" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>  <p>It’s a great read, and really helped me grasp programming in Objective-C.</p>  <p>I also took the Standford iTunesU course – <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs193p/cgi-bin/index.php" target="_blank">CS193P – iPhone Application Development</a>.&#160; This was tremendously valuable.&#160; The best part?&#160; It’s 100% free!</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been working on a little side project (that I&rsquo;ll announce soon).&nbsp; It is an iPhone application that I intend to sell.&nbsp; Being a .NET guy, I&rsquo;m certainly a bit lost when it comes to troubleshooting problems with Objective-C and Cocoa.&nbsp; Hopefully this post will help someone else out that ran into a similar issue.</p>


<p>In Cocoa, any class that derives from UIResponder (which means UIView and all of it&rsquo;s subclasses) can get touch events by implementing these 4 optional methods:</p>




<div><figure role=code><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
<span class='line'>2</span>
<span class='line'>3</span>
<span class='line'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>- (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event;
</div><div class='line'>- (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event;
</div><div class='line'>- (void)touchesCancelled:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event;
</div><div class='line'>- (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event;</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>




<p>With this raw data you can construct any number of touch schemes, such as knowing when to scroll and when to select something, as is the case with UITableView.</p>


<p>UIControl derivatives (such as UIButton) get a simpler abstraction:&nbsp; they use that data &amp; translate it to different events such as <codetouchdowninside>&lt; code&gt;and `touchUpInside`.&nbsp; These don&rsquo;t work for all views, so sometimes to detect a tap you have to roll your own.</codetouchdowninside></p>


<p>In general, you can just look at the touchesEnded event and check the tapCount property to see if the user tapped an element:</p>




<div><figure role=code><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
<span class='line'>2</span>
<span class='line'>3</span>
<span class='line'>4</span>
<span class='line'>5</span>
<span class='line'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>-(void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event {
</div><div class='line'>UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; //assume just 1 touch
</div><div class='line'>if(touch.tapCount == 1) {
</div><div class='line'>//single tap occurred
</div><div class='line'>}
</div><div class='line'>}</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>




<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://flux88.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/DetectingataponaUITextView_8AB1/uitextview_4.png"><img src="/images/uitextview_thumb_1.png" height="283"   /></a></p>


<p>I wanted to use this on a view that contained a full-screen UITextView.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Unfortunately, as of the iPhone SDK 3.0, UITextView swallows this event completely.&nbsp; I imagine because of the new feature where you can select text to copy &amp; paste.&nbsp; You can get touchesBegan, touchesMoved, and touchesCancelled, but no touchesEnded.&nbsp; (In fact, the touch actually gets cancelled by the UITextView).&nbsp; Even by subclassing UITextView I could not get this event.</p>


<p>Luckily I found a work-around.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not exactly pretty, but it works for me.</p>


<p>First I needed to subclass UIWindow so that I can get control at the very beginning of every touch.</p>


<p>Next I needed to change my MainViewController.xib, which creates the window, to point to my new class.</p>


<p>Then, in the sendEvent method, I need to check for 3 things:</p>


<ul>
<li>is this touch ending?</li>
<li>is this touch hitting my custom text view?</li>
<li>is this touch a single tap?</li>
</ul>


<p>Here&#8217; is the code for my custom window:</p>




<div><figure role=code><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
<span class='line'>2</span>
<span class='line'>3</span>
<span class='line'>4</span>
<span class='line'>5</span>
<span class='line'>6</span>
<span class='line'>7</span>
<span class='line'>8</span>
<span class='line'>9</span>
<span class='line'>10</span>
<span class='line'>11</span>
<span class='line'>12</span>
<span class='line'>13</span>
<span class='line'>14</span>

<span class='line'>17</span>
<span class='line'>18</span>
<span class='line'>19</span>
<span class='line'>20</span>
<span class='line'>21</span>
<span class='line'>22</span>
<span class='line'>23</span>
<span class='line'>24</span>
<span class='line'>25</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>//CustomWindow.h
</div><div class='line'>@interface CustomWindow : UIWindow {
</div><div class='line'>}
</div><div class='line'>@end
</div><div class='line'>//CustomWindow.m
</div><div class='line'>#import &quot;CustomTextView.h&quot;
</div><div class='line'>@implementation CustomWindow
</div><div class='line'>-(void)sendEvent:(UIEvent *)event {
</div><div class='line'>//loop over touches for this event

</div><div class='line'>BOOL isSingleTap = (touch.tapCount == 1);
</div><div class='line'>BOOL isHittingCustomTextView =
</div><div class='line'>(touch.view.class == [CustomTextView class]);
</div><div class='line'>if(touchEnded &amp;&amp; isSingleTap &amp;&amp; isHittingCustomTextView) {
</div><div class='line'>CustomTextView *tv = (CustomTextView*)touch.view;
</div><div class='line'>[tv tapOccurred:touch withEvent:event];
</div><div class='line'>}
</div><div class='line'>}
</div><div class='line'>&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial; white-space: normal; ">
</div><div class='line'>&lt;div>&lt;figure role=code>&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">&lt;tr>&lt;td class="gutter">&lt;pre class="line-numbers">&lt;span class='line'>1&lt;/span>
</div><div class='line'>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>&lt;td class='code' width='100%'>&lt;pre>&lt;code class=''>&lt;div class='line'>[super sendEvent:event];&lt;/div>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>&lt;/div>
</div><div class='line'>
</div><div class='line'>&lt;/span>}
</div><div class='line'>@end</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>




<p>If all the 3 BOOLs turn out to be true, then I simply call a method I defined on my CustomTextView.</p>


<p>This CustomTextView then calls a similar method on it&rsquo;s tapDelegate (which I created).&nbsp; My view controller then adheres to the TapDelegateProtocol (which contains this method) and can now detech taps over a UITextView!</p>


<p>Now my textview becomes fullscreen when you tap it, and another tap brings back the tab bar at the bottom and navigation bar at the top.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://heroku.com" target="_blank">Heroku</a> looks to be a very promising way of writing Rails applications with easy deployment, source control, and hosting all built-in.</p>


<p>  <p>Unfortunately, the windows story of <a href="http://rubyonrails.org" target="_blank">Rails</a> development, <a href="http://rubygems.org" target="_blank">ruby gems</a>, <a href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a>, <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/" target="_blank">SQLite</a>, are all incredibly horrible, and make it tough to get started.&#160; Wish I were <a href="http://flux88.com/blog/upgrading-my-hackintosh-to-10-5-7/" target="_blank">on a Mac</a>, but yeah… not on my laptop… yet.</p>  <h3>Step 1:&#160; Install <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/" target="_blank">Cygwin</a></h3>  <p>I can’t stress enough how awesome this tool is.&#160; it gives you a unix-style shell that supports a number of things, namely Git.&#160; You can’t run Git on windows without msys-git or similar and it is required for Heroku.&#160; <em>(Git is the deployment mechanism for packaging up your changes and sending them to Heroku)</em>.</p>  <p>When you install cygwin, make sure to expand the packages and install <em>at least</em> the following:</p>  <ul>   <li>gcc </li>    <li>gcc-g++ </li>    <li>git </li>    <li>git-completion </li>    <li>git-gui </li>    <li>gitk </li>    <li>grep </li>    <li>gzip </li>    <li>libsqlite3-devel </li>    <li>libsqlite3_0 </li>    <li>make </li>    <li>man </li>    <li>openssh </li>    <li>ruby&#160; &lt;—some say this is buggy, but it seems to work for me </li>    <li>sqlite3 </li>    <li>tar </li>    <li>wget </li> </ul>  <p>Wait for it to download and install those packages.&#160; There might be others, but those are the major ones installed on my machine.&#160; If you already have cygwin installed, you can run the setup.exe file again and select the packages you’re missing.</p>  <h3>Step 2:&#160; Install Rubygems</h3>  <p>Note that this is required even if you already have the one-click ruby installer on windows.&#160; Steven Harman wrote about <a href="http://stevenharman.net/blog/archive/2008/11/12/installing-rubygems-in-cygwin.aspx" target="_blank">how to do this in cygwin</a>:</p>  <blockquote>   <ol>     <li><em>Download the RubyGems tarball from </em><a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems/"><em>Ruby Forge</em></a> </li>      <li><em>Unpack the tarball </em></li>      <li><em>In a bash terminal, navigate to the unpacked directory </em></li>      <li><em>Run the following command:</em></p>

<div><figure role=code><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>&lt;em>ruby setup.rb install&lt;/em></div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>


<p></li>
<li><em>Update RubyGems by running the following:</em></p>

<div><figure role=code><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>&lt;em>gem update --system&lt;/em></div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>


<p></li>
</ol></p>

<p><em>Note: You may need to run the updated command twice if you have any previously installed gems.</em></p>


<p></blockquote></p>

<p><em><strong>Note, if you try to run some ruby files and you get a “could not load rubygems” error, you may need to unset the RUBYOPT environment variable.&#160; The windows version might be conflicting with the cygwin version.</strong></em></p>


<h3>Step 3:&#160; Install sqlite3-ruby gem</h3>


<p>The sqlite3-ruby gem is actually a CGem (not ruby) so it needs a windows binary. Unfortunately, there isn’t a windows version yet, so you need to back up to the latest one that does, which is 1.2.3 as of this post.</p>




<div><figure role=code><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>gem install sqlite3-ruby –v 1.2.3</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>




<p><strong></strong></p>


<p><strong>If this fails with an error saying “looking for sqlite.h…no” then you probably haven’t installed the libsqlite3_devel package in cygwin. This tripped me up.</strong></p>


<h3>Step 4: Install json gem</h3>


<p>Again, the latest version of this gem doesn’t work yet with Windows, so you have to request version 1.1.1.</p>




<div><figure role=code><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>gem install json –v 1.1.1</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>




<h3>&#160;</h3>


<h3>Step 5: Install Heroku gem</h3>




<div><figure role=code><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>gem install heroku</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>




<h3>&#160;</h3>


<h3>Step 6: Create an SSH key file</h3>


<p>In order to communicate securely with heroku, you need to create an SSH key file.</p>




<div><figure role=code><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
<span class='line'>2</span>
<span class='line'>3</span>
<span class='line'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>$ cd ~/
</div><div class='line'>$ mkdir .ssh
</div><div class='line'>$ cd .ssh
</div><div class='line'>$ ssh-keygen –C “my key” –t rsa</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>




<p>&#160;</p>


<p>This should create a public &amp; private key file.&#160; Heroku will look for this.</p>


<p>Now we can follow the standard heroku instructions, which are pretty simple.&#160; Here’s how you’d create a sample rails app, initialize git, add files, and create the app on heroku.&#160; Finally we’ll push the code &amp; you can see it running online.</p>




<div><figure role=code><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
<span class='line'>2</span>
<span class='line'>3</span>
<span class='line'>4</span>
<span class='line'>5</span>
<span class='line'>6</span>
<span class='line'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>$ rails foo
</div><div class='line'>$ cd foo
</div><div class='line'>$ git init
</div><div class='line'>$ git add .
</div><div class='line'>$ git commit –m “adding files”
</div><div class='line'>$ heroku create (type in heroku credentials when prompted)
</div><div class='line'>$ git push heroku master</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>




<p>&#160;</p>


<p>You’ll be given a URL when you create the app on heroku, so after you push you can visit <a href="http://your-app-name.heroku.com">http://your-app-name.heroku.com</a> to see it live!</p>


<p>Hope this helps someone else get started faster than me!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A number of people commented on my post about a <a href="http://flux88.com/blog/jquery-auto-complete-text-box-with-asp-net-mvc/">jQuery Autocomplete Textbox in ASP.NET MVC</a> wanting to know how to provide a value for the items being displayed.&#160; It’s not an uncommon request.&#160; For many pieces of data you’ll have display values as well as unique identifiers to distinguish &amp; provide reference to the items.</p>


<p>  <p>Unfortunately it’s not well document, however this is fully supported with <a href="http://dyve.net/jquery/?autocomplete">Dylan Verheul’s jQuery autocomplete plugin</a>.</p>  <p>The first step is to separate your display names from the values in your result from the server.&#160; We were retuning cities before, like this:</p></p>

<div><figure role=code><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
<span class='line'>2</span>
<span class='line'>3</span>
<span class='line'>4</span>
<span class='line'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>HOUSTON, AK
</div><div class='line'>HOUSTON, AL
</div><div class='line'>HOUSTON, TX
</div><div class='line'>HOUCK, AR
</div><div class='line'>HOUGHTON, IA</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>




<p>The individual items are separated by a new line character.&#160; In order to provide a value for each of these, you have to separate the item with a pipe “|”.</p>




<div><figure role=code><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
<span class='line'>2</span>
<span class='line'>3</span>
<span class='line'>4</span>
<span class='line'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>HOUSTON, AK&lt;strong>|456&lt;/strong>
</div><div class='line'>HOUSTON, AL&lt;strong>|1245&lt;/strong>
</div><div class='line'>HOUSTON, TX&lt;strong>|553&lt;/strong>
</div><div class='line'>HOUCK, AR&lt;strong>|99&lt;/strong>
</div><div class='line'>HOUGHTON, IA&lt;strong>|401&lt;/strong></div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>




<p><em>If your display items might contain a pipe character, then you’ll have to change the separator setting for the plugin.&#160; You can do by providing the option <strong>cellSeparator</strong>.</em></p>


<p>Now that our items have a value coming back from the server, how can we retrieve it when an item is selected?&#160; That is done via the onSelectItem function.&#160; This is a callback that will send you the formatted &lt;li&gt; tag.&#160; If there was a value specified, it will be placed in the <em>extra</em> attribute.</p>


<p>Here’s an example:</p>


<p>$(cities).autocomplete(action_url, {
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160; lineSeparator: &#8216;\n&#8217;,
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160; cellSeparator: &#8216;|&#8217;,
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160; onItemSelect: function(li) {&#160; if(li.extra) alert(&quot;You selected &quot; + li.extra[0]); }
<br /> });</p>


<p>I’ve specified the options for lineSeparator and cellSeparator.&#160; These are the default values, but you can easily change them if the character is a valid portion of the text being returned by the server. </p>


<p>You can use this handler to place the selected value in a hidden field to save it for a form submission.</p>


<p>Hope this helps!&#160; For more information, I suggest you read the source code and examine the <a href="http://dyve.net/jquery/?autocomplete" target="_blank">plugin page source</a> for more examples.</p>
