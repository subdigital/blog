<p> <p>We will hold the conference at the Microsoft offices off of Beltway 8 &amp; Briar Forest.&nbsp; Most people are already familiar with this location, which is good.&nbsp; The conference starts in just over a month, so if you&#8217;re an out-of-towner get those travel plans booked!</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve had it with TFS.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a thorn in my side.&nbsp; It sits there, embedded in Visual studio like ivy on a brick wall, mocking me.&nbsp; It&#8217;s like developing in a hot tar pit.&nbsp; Sticky, smelly, and literally the <strong>biggest source of developer pain I feel these days</strong>.&nbsp; I finished up a set of bug fixes and application features that I needed to deploy to QA today.&nbsp;&nbsp; <p>One of them was updating a text file.&nbsp; Easy, right?&nbsp; Just double click the file!&nbsp; WRONG.&nbsp; If you do this you can&#8217;t save it, you need to open Visual Studio &amp; explicitly check-out the file.&nbsp; Then you can edit it.&nbsp; This is done because apparently the developers of TFS decided that Visual Studio is our only editor&#8230;.  <p><strong>Don&#8217;t lock my files, bro!</strong>  <p><a href="http://flux88.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/AStoryofTFSWTFery_FA86/203-41266207d6209dc6_2.png"><img src="/images/203-41266207d6209dc6_thumb.png" alt="203-41266207d6209dc6"  border="0" /></a>  <p>That is a minor gripe, but it&#8217;s pretty substantial when you think about the fact that I have batch files, a NAnt build, configuration files, and a readme&#8230; all of which I&#8217;d like to use either <a href="http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html">Notepad2</a> or <a href="http://e-texteditor.com">e-texteditor</a> to edit.  <p>If I want to edit a text file, Visual Studio is <strong>the last editor on the planet that I want to use</strong>.  <p>Then I finish up some other boring SSRS work and commit it to our dev branch.&nbsp; Our CI build shows success, and I&#8217;m ready to merge to integration, which is where we deploy from.&nbsp; I kick off the deploy process and it fails.&nbsp; Apparently there was a missing file in the integration branch.  <p>This file was a new file in a directory that was already branched, so when mergine shouldn&#8217;t it get merged too?&nbsp; I guess not, because when I go to merge the folder, the new file is excluded.&nbsp; If you right click &amp; try to merge just the file, it shows no branching targets.&nbsp; Ok, so let&#8217;s branch it.&nbsp;&nbsp; <p><a href="http://flux88.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/AStoryofTFSWTFery_FA86/203-41266207ce9264e2_2.png"><img src="/images/203-41266207ce9264e2_thumb.png" alt="203-41266207ce9264e2"  border="0" /></a>  <p>Branching in the same folder?&nbsp; Why on earth would you ever want to do that?&nbsp; That, my friends, is <strong>the path to madness</strong>.&nbsp; I correct the path to branch the file into the integration path.  <p>So I finally do my build again, and get more errors.&nbsp; Reading the build output it looks like some changes still haven&#8217;t made it over.&nbsp; I do another merge on this folder and&#8230;  <p><a href="http://flux88.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/AStoryofTFSWTFery_FA86/203-41266207d6c2f073_2.png"><img src="/images/203-41266207d6c2f073_thumb.png" alt="203-41266207d6c2f073"  border="0" /></a>  <p>then do a diff of the files:  <p><a href="http://flux88.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/AStoryofTFSWTFery_FA86/203-41266207d71aed6b_2.png"><img src="/images/203-41266207d71aed6b_thumb.png" alt="203-41266207d71aed6b"  border="0" /></a>  <p>WTFF!  <p>So I guess now I&#8217;ll need to merge each file, not the directory.&nbsp; Select the files and&#8230;  <p><a href="http://flux88.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/AStoryofTFSWTFery_FA86/203-41266207d8308b91_2.png"><img src="/images/203-41266207d8308b91_thumb.png" alt="203-41266207d8308b91"  border="0" /></a>  <p>Doh!&nbsp; You can&#8217;t branch multiple files via selection like this.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a technical reason, but <strong>I don&#8217;t flippin care</strong>.&nbsp; This is an abismal user-experience.  <p>Ok, so I&#8217;ll branch <em>each one</em> individually&#8230;.&nbsp; Merging individually didn&#8217;t work either:  <p><a href="http://flux88.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/AStoryofTFSWTFery_FA86/203-41266207e0fbd402_2.png"><img src="/images/203-41266207e0fbd402_thumb.png" alt="203-41266207e0fbd402"  border="0" /></a>  <p>At this point I&#8217;m feeling a little bit like this guy:  <p><a href="http://flux88.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/AStoryofTFSWTFery_FA86/60371673_0eb0b14f91_2.jpg"><img src="/images/60371673_0eb0b14f91_thumb.jpg" alt="60371673_0eb0b14f91"  border="0" /></a>  <p><em>(</em><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/dannyboyster"><em>http://flickr.com/photos/dannyboyster</em></a><em>)</em>  <p>So I went to the command-line to try a baseless merge.&nbsp; You can do that like this: 
<div><figure role=code><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>c:\project&gt;tf merge /baseless &lt;source&gt; &lt;target&gt; /recursive</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>

<p>This seemed to do the trick.&nbsp; Time to commit the changes.
<p>Now I&#8217;m greeted with a host of conflicts.&nbsp; I have <strong>never</strong> made code changes to my target branch.&nbsp; I have only merged to it.&nbsp; There should never be an incompatible change!
<p>Now, here&#8217;s what really gets me:&nbsp; I get different conflict resolution <em>language</em> depending on if I select a single file or multiple files.
<p>Single file conflict resolution dialog:
<p><a href="http://flux88.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/AStoryofTFSWTFery_FA86/203-41266207dfeac2f0_2.png"><img src="/images/203-41266207dfeac2f0_thumb.png" alt="203-41266207dfeac2f0"  border="0" /></a>
<p>Multiple file conflict resolution dialog:
<p><a href="http://flux88.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/AStoryofTFSWTFery_FA86/203-41266207dfcdf012_2.png"><img src="/images/203-41266207dfcdf012_thumb.png" alt="203-41266207dfcdf012"  border="0" /></a>
<p>So which is it TFS?&nbsp; Source/Target, or Local/Server?&nbsp; This is so confusing I&#8217;m not sure what to do in the latter.&nbsp; I guess I need discard server version, so I do that.
<p>Two hours after completing my feature work, I&#8217;m finally able to check in the changes, do my deploy, and see it running successfully on the QA box.
<p>What a day.&nbsp; <strong>TFS:&nbsp; I hate you</strong>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m finally able to install .NET 3.5 and run Visual Studio 2008 at my client.&nbsp; Yeah, yeah,&nbsp; &#8221;<em>Welcome to 2008</em>&#8221; I can hear you say.&nbsp; &#8220;You&#8217;re just in time for VS 2010!&#8221;&nbsp; I know&#8230; but big ships turn slowly :)</p>


<p> <p>Anyway, when installing Visual Studio 2008 I was promptly greeted with a slew of errors.&nbsp; Checking the log yielded this not very helpful statement:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>[02/02/09,13:53:22] Microsoft Visual Studio Web Authoring Component: [2] Error code 5 for this component means &#8220;Access is denied.</em></p></blockquote> <p>The knowledge base article it linked to was less than helpful as well.&nbsp; A colleague asked me to crack open McAfee&#8217;s logs and sure enough&#8230; we found this in there:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>2/2/2009&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1:41:20 PM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blocked by Access Protection ru&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ZZZ\user&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d:\wcu\webdesignercore\WebDesignerCore.EXE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\7912618bc3a93fed0bab\autorun.inf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; User-defined Rules:Autorun_inf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Action blocked : Create<br>2/2/2009&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1:53:22 PM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blocked by Access Protection rule&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ZZZ\user d:\wcu\webdesignercore\WebDesignerCore.EXE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\e300576fb9ee95c7e7e9c2cb\autorun.inf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; User-defined Rules:Autorun_inf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Action blocked : Create<br>2/2/2009&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2:02:08 PM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blocked by Access Protection rule&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ZZZ\user d:\wcu\webdesignercore\WebDesignerCore.EXE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\9e98c3f777aff7da331d68c05065b5\autorun.inf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; User-defined Rules:Autorun_inf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Action blocked : Create</em></p></blockquote> <p>That is three separate installation attempts that failed.&nbsp; Luckily my account had the ability to disable the sometimes-annoying-file-blocking-thingy in McAfee Enterprise.</p> <p><img src="/images/mcaffee-file-access-dialog_3.png" alt="mcaffee-file-access-dialog"  border="0" /> </p> <p>If you&#8217;re getting this error, try disabling that guy to install Visual Studio.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t forget to turn it back on though, or the corp network security guys with shotguns might visit your desk wondering why a worm installed on your machine was sending out emails to everyone in the company with a vulgar photo&#8230;</p> <p>Hope this saves someone the 30 minutes it cost me today!</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><br />
<img src="/images/zen-garden.jpg"  style="float:left; margin-right:10px; margin-bottom:10px;"  /> I&#8217;m proud to announce that I&#8217;m organizing a Houston ALT.NET Open Spaces conference April 3rd - 5th, 2009. The open space will be facilitated by <a href="http://www.stevenlist.com/">Doc List</a>.</p>


<p>You can take a look at the <a href="http://houston.altnetconf.com/home">conference website</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;to see more details, and I&#8217;ll open registration soon. I&#8217;m not entirely sure about the cap on attendance yet, but I&#8217;m probably going to limit it to 70-80 to keep costs down.</p>


<p>The event will be held at the Microsoft offices in west Houston, and will be in the style of past ALT.NET conferences:</p>


<ul>
<li>Friday night gathering to suggest topics &amp; come up with a preliminary schedule</li>
<li>Saturday breakfast, opening statements, breakout sessions, lunch</li>
<li>Sunday morning breakfast, break out sessions, closing of the space</li>
</ul>


<p>When I start finalizing the schedule, you&#8217;ll see it on the website.</p>


<p><strong>What can you do?</strong><br /></p>


<p>Boy, I&#8217;m glad you asked! We need sponsors. If you or your company can sponsor (even a small amount) it would make things go a lot smoother. I&#8217;m trying my best to make this conference free for attendees, but I may have to charge a small fee for attendance.</p>


<p>I&#8217;ll also need people with video cameras to come help document the event. We&#8217;ll need a few folks to do this, so that we can capture each session. I&#8217;ll also need someone to bring a <em>ginormous</em> hard drive to collect all of the videos.</p>


<p><strong>What&#8217;s next?</strong></p>


<p>I have to finalize the budget, get the registration setup for the site, gather sponsors, and do general planning. If you&#8217;re interested in helping out in the planning, our next ALT.NET Geek Dinner (week of Feb 9th) will be the perfect time. (or join the mailing list).</p>


<p>I&#8217;m really excited to be putting this on. Past ALT.NET conferences have really challenged me to better my craft, and it&#8217;s time to give back &amp; spread the goodness to my local community. Leave a comment if you&#8217;re planning on attending!</p>

<p>Running OS X on PC hardware isn&#8217;t always easy, I just happened to have the lucky mix of hardware that pretty much just works. The motherboard is the most critical determining factor.</p>

<li>Western Digital 500GB MyBook USB Hard drive</li>
</ul>


<p>You could easily build a PC based on this hardware for under $500. We have sound, lan, any hard drive will do, a decent video card, a fast processor, and 4 GB of memory. I&#8217;m using this on my existing Vista machine, so I decided to install on an external drive. Dual booting is possible, and with USB it&#8217;s easy: just unplug the USB drive to boot in windows. Other options allow you to have a boot menu to choose the OS.</p>


<h2>Where to start</h2>


<p>The definitive place to learn how to do this is the <a href="http://forum.insanelymac.com/">Insanely Mac Forums</a>. Expect to read a TON before you start. Spend most of your time initially in the OSx86 forum.</p>


<h2>The software</h2>


<ul>
<li>I got most of my help from <a href="http://forum.insanelymac.com/index.php?showtopic=86167">this tutorial</a>. It is based on this same hardware, and pretty much worked right away for me.</li>
<li>Kalyway 10.5.2 OS X Installer<br />
You can get this from the usual places. I originally used this install and it worked okay, however I noticed a handful of application crashes and the occasional GSOD (Grey screen of death). We&#8217;re going to use this for the initial boot and to make a utility install. Utility installs will help when things go wrong, like for example if you decide to use a driver (known as kernel extensions or &#8220;kexts&#8221;) and the kext causes a kernel panic on boot, then you can boot in the utility partition and fix it.</li>
<li>Retail Leopard OS X 10.5.5<br />
You can get this at an Apple store, ebay, craigslist, or the usual places. I found one on craigslist for $50.</li>
<li>10.5.6 combo updater</li>
<li>v4.4 utility package from the tutorial author</li>
</ul>


<p>You can get the combo updater and the utility package from the tutorial post. Follow the tutorial and you should be fine.</p>


<h2>BIOS</h2>


<p>Having an updated BIOS is <em>usually</em> a good idea. In my case I had to update to F5. I also had to enable SATA AHCI, which is supposed to increase the reliability of OS X. This made Vista blue screen on boot. Apparently Vista removes unused drivers to speed up boot time. <a href="http://www.itwriting.com/blog/288-enabling-ahci-on-vista.html">Enabling a setting in the registry</a> fixed this.</p>


<h2>Create a utility install with Kalyway</h2>


<p>This is something that was confusing to me. Sort of a chicken and egg problem, but you need to install the retail install from an existing OS X installation. I used the Kalyway installer. I shrunk a partition in Windows by 40GB, then rebooted with the Kalyway DVD. It takes a while, but eventually the OS X installer came up. You then go to Disk Utility and format the partition. Choose Mac Journaled as the format. OSX should install after 10-15 minutes. This is where some folks have hardware issues. If your sound, lan, or video cards don&#8217;t work, then you have to roll up your sleeves and do some manual hacking. I lucked out and mine pretty much worked. It wasn&#8217;t very stable though.</p>


<p>Once you&#8217;re in, you can continue to boot to this install using the boot DVD. I was unable to get any bootloaders to work. This utility install will be helpful to fix any problems that arise from tinkering with the main OS.</p>


<p>From there, I followed this guide which provided me with most of what I needed to get the retail DVD installed, update to 10.5.6, run the postpatch.sh script and reboot. Then I ran the EFI hack which allows you to boot directly into OS X. At this point I set the USB drive to be first priority and viola! Leopard booted.</p>


<h2>Getting 3D Graphics working</h2>


<p>Upon booting the first time the graphics were sluggish and it could only run at 10204x768. There are a number of posts on the topic of video drivers, the problem is some of them are dated. NVinject worked for my 10.5.2 Kalyway install, but did not work for the 10.5.6 retail. Instead I had to use EFI Studio (found in the v4.4 package from earlier) and selected the 8600 GT 512 MB item.<img src="/images/efistudio.png"  alt="efistudio.png"  /></p>


<p>Then I clicked &#8220;Add Device&#8221; which brought up this window:</p>


<p><img src="/images/efistudio2.png"  alt="efistudio2.png"  /></p>


<p>Then click &#8220;write to com.apple.Boot.plist&#8221;, reboot and you&#8217;re good! To get sound working I had to install the <a href="http://forum.insanelymac.com/index.php?act=attach&#38;type=post&#38;id=20698">ALC888 kext</a>.</p>


<h2>Installing kexts</h2>


<p>Installing kexts is basically copying a file to /System/Library/Extensions, fixing up the permissions on the file(s) with</p>




<div><figure role=code><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>sudo chmod -R 755 /System/Library/Extensions/yourkext.kext&lt;br />sudo chown -R root:wheel /System/Library/Extensions/yourkext.kext</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>




<p>then you need to remove the kext caches like so:</p>




<div><figure role=code><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>sudo rm -R /System/Library/Extensions.kextcache&lt;br />sudo rm -R /System/Library/Extensions.mkext</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>




<p>Reboot and cross your fingers! If you get a kernel panic, then just boot in single user mode (press F8 at boot and type -s at the prompt) (or boot your utility install) and remove the offending kexts.</p>


<p>I found it easy to automate this process using <a href="http://cheetha.net/">KextHelper</a>.</p>


<p>At this point I have a fully retail copy of 10.5.6, and I&#8217;m a &#8220;Mac Pro&#8221; in the eyes of Apple. This means (I think) that I can update to future versions with little to no tweaking!</p>


<p><br />
<img src="/images/about-this-mac.png"  alt="about-this-mac.png"  /></p>


<p><br />
<img src="/images/about-this-mac2.png"  alt="about-this-mac2.png"  /></p>


<p>If I were to build a Mac Pro from apple.com with these specs, <strong>it would cost near $3000!</strong></p>


<h2>Things still to figure out</h2>


<p>My Microsoft Lifecam v1000 doesn&#8217;t quite work. I got it to work in iChat for a few minutes, but doesn&#8217;t work in Photobooth or Skype. This is a minor setback, as I can just buy a supported one.</p>


<p>My RAID array isn&#8217;t visible. I have 2x250gb drives in RAID 1 (stripe). I need to investigate &#38; see if there are drivers for my SATA raid card. All in all it&#8217;s a small loss.</p>


<p>VNC comes built-in with 10.5.6, however it&#8217;s SO SLOOOOWWW over the internet. Remote Desktop is far superior because they aren&#8217;t streaming bitmaps, it is actually rendering a desktop locally &#38; transmitting state changes. I really want to find a better solution for accessing my PC remotely.</p>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>


<p>This system has been really stable so far. I&#8217;ve had one crash, and I&#8217;m not sure what caused it, but a week has gone by with no lockups or crashes whatsoever. I&#8217;m really close to ditching my Vista install and put this on my fast Western Digital Raptor main drive.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thanks to HDNUG for inviting me to speak again.&nbsp; I always enjoy it.&nbsp; The crowd was a little thin this time around, but I think that&#8217;s because the website wasn&#8217;t updated with the meeting information in time.</p>


<p> <p>I spoke about latest updates to the ASP.NET MVC Framework, and did some off-the-cuff coding to demonstrate the features.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t get a chance to touch on a few subjects, but all in all I think it was well received.</p> <p>I made the point early on that ASP.NET MVC is an option, and that not everyone would get it.&nbsp; That&#8217;s fine!&nbsp; It&#8217;s meant for a specific type of developer who cares deeply about certain things, namely control over HTML, URLS, tight integration with HTTP and Javascript, and ajax.&nbsp; And who can possibly leave out better separation of concerns &amp; testability.</p> <p><img src="/images/mvc-an-option_3.png" alt="mvc-an-option"  border="0" /> </p> <p>There were certainly folks in the camp that didn&#8217;t get it in the audience.&nbsp; I hope that I adequately represented what MVC is and how it works well on ASP.NET.</p> <p>You can <a href="http://benscheirman.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/presentations/hdnug%20%2001-2009/hdnug%2009.pptx" target="_blank">download the slides for the talk</a>, however I am unable to post the code because it references a private release that I cannot distribute.&nbsp; As soon as the RC becomes available, I&#8217;ll post the code online.</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What kind of blogger would I be if I didn&#8217;t do a recap of the year?&nbsp; <em>Well I guess since I&#8217;ve never done this before, not a very good one.</em>&nbsp; 2008 was a phenomenal year.</p>


<p> <h2></h2> <h2>Me</h2> <p>I started out the year doing my <a href="http://flux88.com/blog/asp-net-mvc-tour-of-texas/">ASP.NET MVC Tour of Texas</a>, where I visited San Antonio, Austin, Fort Worth, and Houston talking about ASP.NET MVC.&nbsp; It must have gotten some notice, because shortly after I was invited to be a co-author for <a href="http://manning.com/palermo" target="_blank">ASP.NET MVC in Action</a>.&nbsp; The book is getting close to being completed, so expect to see it on store shelves in the coming months.</p> <p>In April, I attended the 2nd ALT.NET gathering, which inspirational and eye-opening (<a href="http://flux88.com/blog/alt-net-day-1/">Day1</a>, <a href="http://flux88.com/blog/alt-net-day-2/">Day2</a>, <a href="http://flux88.com/blog/alt-net-day-2-continued/">Day2.2</a>, <a href="http://flux88.com/blog/alt-net-day-3/">Day3</a>).</p> <p>In May <a href="http://flux88.com/blog/i-m-an-insider/">I became an ASP Insider</a>.&nbsp; This has been the very best way to give my feedback to Microsoft about upcoming releases.&nbsp; Also in May I started holding semi-regular <a href="http://flux88.com/blog/houston-alt-net-geek-dinner-next-tuesday/">Houston ALT.NET Geek Dinners</a>.</p> <p>In September, the nasty hurricane Ike rolled through Houston, luckily <a href="http://flux88.com/blog/ike-is-gone-we-re-okay/">we made it through with little damage</a>.&nbsp; Others were not as fortunate.</p> <p>In October <a href="http://flux88.com/blog/recent-developments/">I was given the Microsoft MVP Award for ASP.NET</a>.&nbsp; I&#8217;m looking forward to going to the summit next March &amp; meeting other MVPs from around the world.</p> <p>I attended <a href="http://kaizenconf.com/" target="_blank">KaizenConf</a> in November, which was really great.&nbsp; Every time I go to one of these conferences I feel energized to go out and do good in the world.&nbsp; It sounds cheesy, but it&#8217;s really great.&nbsp; I hope that others find their way out of the mainstream marketing jungle of conferences and attend one of these open spaces.</p> <p>In December, my wife and I found out that <a href="http://flux88.com/blog/hello-world-x-2/">we are having twins</a>!&nbsp; For those counting, we&#8217;ll now have a full basketball team :).&nbsp; Needless to say 2009 will be a busy year.</p> <h2>The blog</h2> <p>This blog has gone under some transition too.&nbsp; Originally I was using <a href="http://dasblog.info" target="_blank">dasBlog</a> hosted at <a href="http://webhost4life.com" target="_blank">WebHost4Life</a> and things worked pretty well.&nbsp; I wanted to have some more control over what I could do with my server, so I ordered a VPS plan with VPS Land.&nbsp; That turned out to be a big mistake.&nbsp; </p> <p>I quickly moved over to a VPS over at <a href="http://godaddy.com" target="_blank">GoDaddy</a> which worked out okay for most of the year.&nbsp; It turns out their domain service is better than their hosting service.&nbsp; My blog kept making it run out of memory, so I moved my blog over to <a href="http://www.orcsweb.com" target="_blank">Orcsweb</a>.&nbsp; I also ported the content over to Graffiti, and so far it has been smooth sailing ever since.&nbsp; I still host my <a href="http://silvia.flux88.com" target="_blank">wife&#8217;s</a> and <a href="http://heather.flux88.com" target="_blank">sister&#8217;s</a> blogs on GoDaddy, as well as my <a href="http://www.cripplecreekwoodworks.com" target="_blank">uncle&#8217;s furniture business</a>.</p> <h2>What&#8217;s in store for 2009?</h2> <p>I have a few goals for 2009 that I&#8217;d like to publicly share, if for no other reason than to really commit to it.&nbsp; I&#8217;d like to wrap up the book.&nbsp; It is time consuming like you wouldn&#8217;t believe, and I&#8217;ll be glad when it&#8217;s over.&nbsp; </p> <p>I&#8217;d also like to read more.&nbsp; It seems that I only read 6 or 7 books in 2008, and that&#8217;s pathetic.&nbsp; At the rate that my book list is growing, I&#8217;ll never read all that I want.&nbsp; So far 99% of the books on my list are about software development, and I&#8217;d like to change that.&nbsp; I&#8217;m starting to get interested in other things, like GTD, organization, fiction&#8230;&nbsp; I need to broaden my horizons.</p> <p>I&#8217;d like to do another long series of posts, similar to my <a href="http://flux88.com/blog/a-journey-with-nhibernate-part-1/" target="_blank">Journey with NHibernate</a> series.&nbsp; It still remains my all time most popular set of posts, and now the material is a little dated.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve learned a lot since then.&nbsp; I&#8217;m definitely open to ideas.</p> <p>I&#8217;m also going to get back into guitar.&nbsp; In 2008 I really didn&#8217;t play more than once a month, and it shows.&nbsp; My fingers are soft, I&#8217;ve forgotten how to play many songs, and I&#8217;ve definitely lost my technique for fingering.&nbsp; It&#8217;s all chords now.&nbsp; I&#8217;m looking at purchasing a new electric guitar to help give me the nudge.</p> <p>Lastly, I would like to do another speaking tour, only this time I&#8217;m not sure what topic.&nbsp; It was a ton of fun, and maybe this time I can get a sponsor to help me visit more cities.</p> <p>So long 2008, you were great.</p></p>
