<p>The only other viable option that I saw was Thunderbird, and I likedit for the most part.&nbsp; Sure, it doesn’t have a calendar or tasklist, but most people don’t use those features anyway.</p>


<p>I am going to have to put away Thunderbird for good, as it likes torandomly reject my SMTP settings for no reason.&nbsp; It will work fineone day, and refuse to send mail the next.&nbsp; Outlook hasn’t evercomplained about the settings so…&nbsp; </p>


<p>Anyone else share my sentiments about outlook?&nbsp; What other solid email clients are out there that are worth looking at?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><P>Well Houston is definitely panicked.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t want to be around a mob of lunatics, so we packed up our stuff and went to Dallas via Bellville, Brenham, Temple and Waco, which turned out to be a huge success.&nbsp; We made it to Dallas safely in 6 hours, which was much more desirable than the 24 hour wait on I45.</P>


<P>I hope everyone in Houston is safe, because it&#8217;s going to be incredibly difficult to get out of the city now.&nbsp; I&#8217;m glad we left when we did.</P>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My mom died last Wednesday, due to advanced ovarian cancer. She was 53. It has been quite a sad household for the past week and a half, and I don&#8217;t expect it to get better anytime soon. I will really miss her. </p>


<p>Her funeral was on Saturday and the service was beautiful. Many people were present and I knew most of them. </p>


<p>My mother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2001 and fought it for more than 3 years before deciding to choose quality of life over longevity. Cancer is an ugly thing. I&#8217;m glad she did get a lot of good moments and memories in the past year and a half that we&#8217;ve been taking care of her. </p>


<p>Anyway, consider making a small donation to the <a href="http://www.ocrf.org/site/c.kwK0JbNTJtF/b.574943/k.CBC0/Home.htm" target="_blank">Ovarian Cancer Research Fund</a>. </p>


<p>During this tragedy I didn&#8217;t get out much, and had no idea about Hurricane Katrina until yesterday. The Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund is in need of cash donations, and I&#8217;m glad the Buzz stepped up. They are going to try and hit $500k by the end of the day. I really respect what they are doing.&nbsp; What a sad month it has been&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have heard so many discussions (read: arguments) about which DAL method is the best and nobody ever has a clear-cut case for all solutions.&nbsp; Previously I have sort of&nbsp; &ldquo;rolled my own&rdquo; data layer, with a simple helper class and some parametrized queries.&nbsp; This has slowly grown into a very lite version of the Data Access Application Block from Microsoft (which kinda makes me grin, b/c that wasn&rsquo;t the intent).</p>


<p>The last project I started used NHibernate.&nbsp; It really did make a lot of things easy, and definitely sped up development.&nbsp; I was a little weary of the learning curve (which only gets steeper the more complex your schema gets), but I eventually came up with a solid solution that has held up well.&nbsp; I did have to make certain design considerations using NHibernate, which I didn&rsquo;t like, but I got over it.</p>


<p>Anyway, I get to start fresh on a new project again and I&rsquo;m back at the same step:&nbsp; how should I shape my data layer?&nbsp; Should I use NHibernate again?&nbsp; Should I use CSLA.NET?</p>


<p>Here&rsquo;s what I am considering:</p>


<ul><li>My own hand-made DAL.</li><li>CSLA.NET</li><li>Use Enterprise Library (specifically the Data Access Application Block)</li><li>NHibernate </li></ul>


<p>Right now I&rsquo;m leaning toward CSLA, because I think it might integrate quite nicely with a large project we currently have, where the DAL it uses (well, only about 25% of the code even uses the middle tier) is sort of primitive. (anyway, don&rsquo;t get me started on this, it&rsquo;s a mess that needs to be cleaned up)</p>


<p>My goal is to provide a boilerplate DAL that ALL of our upcoming projects can utilize effectively (large or small).&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>

<p><strong>I am young and my brain is like a sponge.&nbsp; </strong>I read as many books as I can find the time, and there are always 2 or 3 that I want to read next&hellip; ALWAYS.&nbsp; I read developer blogs religiously in hopes of gaining more knowledge in my travels as a developer.&nbsp; The deeper I go, the more I love it! <p></p><p><strong>I get more involved with the community every day</strong>.&nbsp; Since I completed my Computer Science degree at the University of Houston in December I have been posting questions and answers on the ASP.NET forums, I have published and updated an article on Code Project that got&nbsp;pretty good reviews, and I plan to give a &ldquo;tips n tricks&rdquo; presentation at the next Houston .NET User Group.&nbsp; This will be my first attempt at speaking,&nbsp;and I&rsquo;m a bit nervous, but I think it&rsquo;ll be fun and hopefully I can spread&nbsp;some of my experience to others.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>I attended my first conference recently, Houston DevCon 2005, and absolutely loved it.&nbsp; &nbsp;I can only imagine how fun it would be to attend.&nbsp; I pleaded with my boss to send me to DevConnections, then TechEd, and finally a local, cheap, 1 day conference came (DevCon) and I was able to attend.&nbsp; </p><p><strong>I am an active blogger.</strong>&nbsp; I try to post something worthwile every day or so.&nbsp; Since I find a lot of humor and professional advice in the blogs I read, I hope to pass that on to some junior developers trying to make sense of it all.&nbsp; Hopefully my experiences and thoughts might help others aspiring to be successful developers.</p><p><strong></strong>I know everybody is going to do this, but it&rsquo;s still valid.&nbsp;I vow to blog religiously about my experiences at the PDC, take pictures and post them here, and generally spread my enthusiasm about the developer community to others.&nbsp; I might get a little creative with my camera and try and do some amateur interviews.</p><p><strong>Finally, my kids just&nbsp;want me to shutup about it!</strong>&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been talking about going for so long now, they can&rsquo;t stand it!&nbsp; </p><p align="center"><img height="304" alt="Pdcbanner" src="http://ben.lyntonweb.com/blog/uploads/pdcbanner.jpg" width="400" align="textTop" border="1" / /></p><p align="center">I even have some audio supporters!&nbsp; Listen to them recommend me!&nbsp; </p><p align="center">(umm, no, they aren&rsquo;t robots &mdash; what are you, nuts?)</p><p align="center"><a href="http://ben.lyntonweb.com/blog/uploads/robotVoicePDC.wav">Mike</a> wants me to go.</p><p align="center">So does <a href="http://ben.lyntonweb.com/blog/uploads/robotVoicePDC2.wav">Crystal</a></p><p align="center"><a href="http://ben.lyntonweb.com/blog/uploads/robotVoicePDC3.wav">Even Rosa, the hispanic lady at the local dry cleaners wants me to go!</a>&nbsp;(hey, how does she know I like .NET?)</p><p align="center">(oh, and thanks for looking!)</p></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have been playing MOH: European Assault for XBox lately, and I think it is a pretty solid WW2 shooter.&nbsp; The controller gun action is pretty easy to get used to (I&rsquo;m so used to a mouse it&rsquo;s sometimes hard to play on a console).&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what is is that attracts me to WW2 shooters over others like Viet Nam or futuristic ones.&nbsp; Maybe it&rsquo;s the terrain, maybe it&rsquo;s the time period, I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m addicted and I play just about every single one that comes out.</p>


<p>One thing is bugging me though.&nbsp; Why is it that in just about EVERY World War 2 game I&rsquo;ve ever played snipers pop out of windows on the 2nd or 3rd floor, you shoot them, and they fall <strong>forward</strong> out of the window.&nbsp; For a genre of games that are supposed to be incredibly realistic, that just seems stupid.&nbsp; In 1944 did bullets actually pull people toward the shooter?&nbsp; Not only is this dumb because it happens, but also because it happens to <strong>ANYONE </strong>who is standing near a ledge.&nbsp; I know for a fact if I shoot this guy on the water tower that he&rsquo;s going to fall over the railing.</p>


<p>Here&rsquo;s a screenshot of what I&rsquo;m talking about:</p>


<p><img height="300" alt="Moh_falloutofwindow" src="http://ben.lyntonweb.com/blog/uploads/moh_falloutofwindow_small.jpg" width="400" align="textTop" border="0" /></p>


<p>Of all of the WW2 shooters out so far, here are my favorites:</p>


<p><strong>Brothers in Arms</strong> &ndash; I love the realistic team play.&nbsp; I rarely play a game like this twice, but this one was an exception.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t wait for BIA 2.</p>


<p><strong>Call of Duty</strong> (and expansion) &ndash; This game was so cinematic, it really kicked MOH out of my favorite spot for a while.&nbsp; I keep playing this one, simply because it&rsquo;s so immersive.</p>


<p><strong>Battlefield 1942</strong> &ndash; I played this game for hours on end.&nbsp; The sniper rifle was more realistic than you usually find in games (some people probably found it annoying, but I found it challenging).&nbsp; I got pretty good at hitting running enemies from 300 yards away, leading the crosshairs in front of their heads by about 2 inches.&nbsp; Yummy.</p>


<p><strong>MOH Frontline</strong> &ndash; I feel that this game really set the stage.&nbsp; It had a great soundtrack and really felt like Saving Private Ryan.&nbsp; The other Medal of Honors didn&rsquo;t quite capture the atmosphere like this one, but they were fun to play nonetheless.</p>
