  <div class="entry-content"><p>People who know me can tell you that I have about zero patience for software.&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially software that is so integral to my day-to-day use of the computer.</p>


<p>One such program is my media player.&nbsp; I have tried pretty much every single one out there, and I haven&rsquo;t been too impressed with any of them.&nbsp; I constantly evaluate these programs and usually just end up settling.&nbsp; </p>


<p><em>(I should also note that I&rsquo;m probably the only person on the planet that doesn&rsquo;t have an iPod.&nbsp; Heck, </em><a title="pope has an ipod" href="http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0601282.htm" target="new"><em>even the Pope has one</em></a><em>!)</em></p>


<ul><li><strong>Windows Media Player &ndash; </strong>The library integration is weak and not very usable for me.&nbsp; The built-in cd burner is piss-poor, and I generally don&rsquo;t like the interface.&nbsp; I usually just use this for viewing temporary media (like my phone&rsquo;s voicemail or little video clips).&nbsp;&nbsp;The built-in taskbar toolbar is KICKASS and more media players should do this.</li><li><strong>WinAMP</strong> &ndash; Fantastic for a file-based collection, but I have grown to need more.&nbsp; My library was out of control and I was tired of manually tagging/renaming.&nbsp; The media library didn&rsquo;t suit me.&nbsp; The visualizations are top-notch and the skin community is HUGE.&nbsp; I like the interface, but again, I needed more control over my library.</li><li><strong>MusicMatch </strong>&ndash; As much as I&rsquo;d like this one to work for me, it still didn&rsquo;t feel right.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t get a good view of my music, and I was sick of it trying to get me to subscribe to it&rsquo;s mp3 download service.&nbsp; I uninstalled it.</li><li><strong>iTunes &ndash; </strong>I have chosen to stick with this one for now.&nbsp; The interface is pretty well thought-out and I really like the smart playlists.&nbsp; The ability to share music on the local network is very nice, though I&rsquo;d like this to be able to stream over the internet as well (authenticated, of course).&nbsp; It has decent support for podcast subscriptions, though a bit-torrent-aware plugin would be nice for this.&nbsp; I also like the ability to rate songs easily.</li></ul>


<p>I gathered some tips on generating some good smart playlists from <a title="andy budd's blogography" href="http://www.andybudd.com/archives/2005/08/itunes_smart_playlists/index.php" target="_blank">Andy Budd</a>.&nbsp; Basically this keeps my playlists <em>alive</em> and I can rate songs to help shape the playlists.&nbsp; I can un-check songs that I don&rsquo;t want to be included in ANY playlist (like stand-up comedy, podcasts,&nbsp;or 0:20 long tracks that are skits or preludes to other songs on the same cd).</p>


<p>So now that the media situation was settled, I needed a nice way to keep my music in sync from my desktop and laptop (at work).&nbsp; I&rsquo;d still like streaming ability over the internet, but these are the machines I use most, so they&rsquo;ll have to do.&nbsp; At the advice of <a title="computer zen" href="http://www.computerzen.com/" target="_blank">Scott Hanselman</a>&nbsp;I decided to give <a title="foldershare" href="https://www.foldershare.com/" target="_blank">FolderShare</a> another go.&nbsp; This time around I noticed that 2 things changed:</p>


<ul><li>Microsoft bought them out</li><li>Now it&rsquo;s FREE!</li></ul>


<p>This definitely got me interested.&nbsp; I decided to setup my mp3 folder as my share folder and installed FolderShare on both PCs.&nbsp; When I get new music in, I import it using iTunes (which copies and renames the files) and will automatically be synchronized with the other PC.&nbsp; That means I can import music on either my laptop or my desktop and everything will stay organized.&nbsp; This is a big plus for me.</p>


<p>So far this is working out fairly well.&nbsp; If I rename or change the tag of a file, then the whole file has to be transferred back to the other PC, so this can use up quite a bit of bandwidth.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t run into any issues with this so far.</p>


<p>Some other cool music links are:</p>


<ul><li><a title="musicbrainz" href="http://musicbrainz.org/" target="_blank">MusicBrainz Tagger</a> &ndash; This open-source free service is a GREAT idea.&nbsp; Basically it will scan your mp3&rsquo;s, make a digital footprint of each one, then try to match it with the online database.&nbsp; It will give you a percentage of confidence so you can setup to automatically tag those files that are 90% or greater and sift through the ones it wasn&rsquo;t sure about.&nbsp; If it cannot find a match, it will ask you to help the community out and supply some tag info.&nbsp; This can run in the background to automatically organize your mp3s.&nbsp; Very cool.</li><li><a title="itunes registry" href="http://www.itunesregistry.com/" target="_blank">iTunes Registry</a>&nbsp;&ndash; Upload your iTunes playlists and get suggestions based on data from the other uploaded playlists.&nbsp; See what other people are listening to.</li><li><a href="http://www.musicmobs.com/">music mobs</a>&nbsp;&ndash; Mark songs that you like and see what other people suggest.</li></ul>


<p>Are there any other helpful media links that I might add here?</p>


<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">UPDATE:</font>&nbsp; </strong>I recently saw some issues when synchronizing the folders that iTunes manages on both ends.&nbsp; If one iTunes collection modifies a filename or adds a file to the list, the 2nd iTunes will not pick it up, since I am not sync&rsquo;ing the iTunes .xml files.&nbsp; To fix this, I found a script that will scan your folder and re-import all of the songs.&nbsp; Best of all, this will&nbsp;*not* reset your playcounts, ratings,&nbsp;or tag info.&nbsp; This includes songs that were not already in your library, so it&rsquo;s perfect for me.&nbsp; If you use it, make sure and edit it to include your music directory.</p>


<p><a title="iTunes folder sync script" href="http://waves.ky/iTunes/iTunesFolderSync.js" target="_blank">Click here for the iTunes Folder Sync script.</a>&nbsp; Thanks to Garreth Farrington for this.&nbsp; (Anybody want to wrap this script in an easier-to-use app?)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Oy.</p>


<p>My hard drive that stored my subversion repository burned up.&nbsp; No, really.&nbsp; It <strong>burned</strong> up.&nbsp; I saw smoke coming from one of the ICs on the PCB.</p>


<p>The drive is still under warranty, but I don&rsquo;t care about the drive.&nbsp; Hard drives are cheap.&nbsp; This contained three large personal projects, a <strong>boatload</strong> of mp3s, tax&nbsp;documents from the last 3 years, and unfortunately something non-replaceable:&nbsp; A recording of my mom singing a lullaby that she wrote.</p>


<p>I spoke to some data recovery people, and I got prices ranging from $1000 &ndash; $2500, and they are pretty confident in getting the data back.&nbsp; The problem is that I am trying to save money for my wedding, and shelling out a grand for data recovery is out of the question at this time.</p>


<p>My other option is to buy an <strong>identical</strong> drive and just replace the PCB.&nbsp; It looks easy enough, but I need to make sure that the PCB is the exact same one.&nbsp; From what it looks like, there&rsquo;s only 4 solder points, going directly <em>into</em> the drive controlling the heads.&nbsp; </p>


<p>What should I do?&nbsp; Should I attempt this ghetto-recovery?&nbsp; Should I pay the $1k?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.benday.com/" target="_blank">Benjamin Day</a>&nbsp;spoke at Visual Studio live this year and was interviewed by Channel 9.&nbsp; He talks about NHibernate.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t know what NHibernate is, it&rsquo;s an object-relational mapper aiming to reduce/eliminate common data access code.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s based on the mature Hibernate for Java, and has growing community support.</p>


<p>Anyway, Ben Day and I used to shoot ideas back and forth and talk about NHibernate patterns and limitations.&nbsp; He mentions me in the podcast (!), which you can download <a title="channel 9" href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Showpost.aspx?postid=165139" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Internal applications commonly utilize Active Directory to manage their user-base.&nbsp; With this approach organizations can define the users and roles in one central location, and have that information available to many applications.</p>


<p>For intranet websites, this is accomplished by using Integrated Windows Authentication.&nbsp; But what happens when you are developing on a machine that does not have the same accounts as the target environment?&nbsp; Case in point:&nbsp; say you have some Active Directory&nbsp;domain groups that define who the &ldquo;readers&rdquo; of an appliciation are and who the &ldquo;editors&rdquo; are.&nbsp; The simple&nbsp;solution is to make these groups configurable through the web.config, and you can have something like this for development:</p>


<div><figure role=code><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>&lt;add key=&rdquo;adminRole&rdquo; value=&rdquo;Administrators&rdquo; /&gt;</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>


<p>and something like this for production:</p>

<div><figure role=code><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>&lt;add key=&rdquo;adminRole&rdquo; value=&rdquo;DOMAIN\ApplicationAdmins&rdquo; /&gt;</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>


<p>This gives us the benefit of using a local machine account for debugging the different roles, and allows for Integrated Windows Authentication to work properly.</p>


<p>Here&rsquo;s another concern.&nbsp; What if your code accesses a secure resource like a database or web service that requires valid Windows credentials and authorization?&nbsp; A test database can easily be configured to accept SQL Authentication provided via connection string, but a Web Service that requires integrated Windows authentication?&nbsp; Would you really want to mock a complex external dependency like this (Especially if it is a <em>read-only</em> dependency) ??&nbsp; If you do you end up spending a large portion of your time just setting up the environment to develop in.&nbsp; </p>


<p>I was dealing with a scenario just like this and I wanted to do use the web.config&rsquo;s <strong>impersonate=&rdquo;true&rdquo;<em> </em></strong>feature where I can supply a username &amp; password to run as (You can even configure it to encrypt this data and store it in the registry using aspnet_setreg.exe&hellip; see <a title="MSDN - aspnet_setreg.exe" href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;329290" target="_blank">here</a>).&nbsp; The problem here is that if I give it&nbsp;a valid domain account to impersonate, my local machine cannot authenticate me unless I join the computer to a domain.&nbsp; For a lot of scenarios this is way too much to ask, and may&nbsp;not even be an option.</p>


<p>I could end up just constructing a NetworkCredentials object with the credentials I need to access the secure web service, but I don&rsquo;t like that approach either.&nbsp; It requires me to specify an account in plain text (either in code or in web.config&hellip; both of which are bad ideas.</p>


<p>Any thoughts on this?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well my webhost crashed and I lost a month of posts.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m trying to see if I can find a more recent backup, but for now this will have to do.</p>


<p>I moved over to webhost4life.&nbsp; They have pretty good hosting for $10/month for:</p>


<ul><li>asp.net 2.0</li><li>sql server 2000</li><li>sql server 2005</li><li>mail</li></ul>


<p>The only downside is that you have to pay $15/year for each domain that points to a folder other than your root.&nbsp; So if you have 2 sites, you&rsquo;ll have to put them in their own subdirectory, and pay a little extra to get the domain to point there.</p>


<p>Still not a bad deal for 2 sites, $150 for a year, including mail.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was installing Sharepoint Portal Server 2003 at a client site this week.&nbsp; During and after the install we were getting very strange errors, eventually leaving the site useless until we could figure them out.&nbsp; Installing WSS Service Pack 2 and SPS Service Pack 2 helped get through the installation, but even after the site was completely installed, we still received lots of errors.<br><br>It turns out that IIS didn&#8217;t have script maps for ASP.NET 1.1, so only 2.0 showed up in the list.&nbsp; Though the updates are supposed to work with 2.0, my experience tells me otherwise.&nbsp; Sharepoint Portal Server 2003 <em>definitely</em> has issues if you run it in 2.0.&nbsp; To add the option for 1.1 in IIS, you can run:<br></p>

<div><figure role=code><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>c:\windows\Microsoft .NET\Framework\v1.1433\aspnet_regiis -i&lt;br></div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>


<p>This will reinstall the script maps for that version into IIS.&nbsp; I changed the SPS site to use 1.1,&nbsp; but I still received errors.&nbsp; <br><br>A reinstall put the site back on 2.0, which was quite odd&#8230;&nbsp; I got the same errors as before.&nbsp; Finally, to fix it I <i>disabled</i> 2.0 in IIS 6.0&#8217;s Web Service Extensions section.&nbsp; Then I reinstalled SPS, which was then forced to use 1.1.&nbsp; All was well with the world after that&#8230;<br></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While developing a small website this week I ran across an unusual error.&nbsp; </p>


<p>When on my lapop, I generally remote into my desktop PC because it has Visual Studio and all the tools I need.</p>


<p>I decided to use a SqlExpress file as the database, since there won&rsquo;t be much data for the application.&nbsp; This worked for about 2 weeks until I got this error upon opening a connection:</p>


<p><!--StartFragment --><span><i><strong>Failed to generate a user instance of SQL Server due to a failure in starting the process for the user instance. The connection will be closed.</strong></i></span></p>


<p><span>This error has to do with the fact that I am using remote desktop to develop.&nbsp; When I access a file-based sql express database, the data is actually copied locally, which is why it takes so long to start up.&nbsp; </span></p>


<p><span><a href="http://blogs.advantaje.com/blog/kevin/Net/?permalink=SQLExpress-Problems.html" target="_blank">Kevin Jones</a> says:</span></p>


<p><span><em>SQLExpress creates a directory per user in &#8220;c:\Documents and Settings\[user]\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\Microsoft SQL Server Data\SQLEXPRESS&#8221; that it uses to store information. Deleting this directory has fixed both of my problems. </em></span></p>


<p><span>I&rsquo;ll update this with my results.</span></p>


<p style="'background-color:" lemonchiffon; border: 1px solid goldenrod; display: block;'><span><strong>Update:&nbsp; </strong>It worked!&nbsp; How weird.&nbsp; This fix definitely looks temporary but it&rsquo;s working for me so far.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On Thursday, I was involved in a serious car accident.&nbsp; I hit a dump truck head on.</p>


<p>My car was mangled beyond belief, both airbags deployed, and I was in bad shape.&nbsp; My right leg was obviously broken;&nbsp;it looked like a pillow doubled-over on itself. (Ouch!)&nbsp; My left arm was also obviously broken.</p>


<p>Paramedics arrived quickly, they pulled me out of my car (quite painfully) and I was laid on a stretcher.&nbsp; I heard someone say &ldquo;be still, this might hurt,&rdquo; and then followed the most painful thing I have ever encountered.&nbsp; He pulled my leg to re-set my femur.&nbsp; My leg popped loudly 3 times while I begged him to stop.</p>


<p>I was put on a helicopter and flown to the hospital.</p>


<p>Later that evening I had surgery on my arm and leg.&nbsp; On my right femur, they inserted a titanium rod to fuse the bones back together.&nbsp; For my left radius, they inserted a few pins to fasten a loose piece of bone.</p>


<p>I stayed in the hospital until Tuesday evening.&nbsp; I am home now, basically immobile for I assume quite a while.</p>


<p>I guess I should consider myself lucky.&nbsp; I am thankful for&nbsp;all my friends and family who showed support and came to visit or called during this tragedy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I was working with a simple form, a single textbox at the top with a button for adding items, and a gridview below for editing/deleting.</p>


<p>With 2.0&rsquo;s validation groups, we can have validation on the &ldquo;Add&rdquo; form by setting <em>validationgroup=&rsquo;AddGroup&rsquo; </em>and we can have our CommandField column of the GridView have <em>validationGroup=&rsquo;editDelete&rsquo;</em>.&nbsp; Ideally this will separate the 2 actions into their own validation groups and they won&rsquo;t bother each other.</p>


<p>Well, if you are using ImageButtons instead of LinkButtons for your CommandField, there is&nbsp;a slight problem.&nbsp; The ImageButton actually gets instantiated as DataControlImageButton, which cannot use the <em>CausesValidation </em>property.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s what happens:</p>


<p><img height="228" alt="DumbException" src="http://ben.lyntonweb.com/blog/uploads/dumbException_small.jpg" width="500" border="1" /></p>


<p>Now why does this generate a <strong>NotSupportedException</strong>?&nbsp; This is a perfectly valid scenario for validation?&nbsp; In this particular case I do not care about the edit/delete validation, but I do care about the Add validation.&nbsp; </p>


<p>If I change this scenario to work with LinkButton or just Plain Button, it all works out fine.</p>


<p>I have another rant regarding this same concept.&nbsp; The above screenclip is showing the RowDataBound event handler, and I am looping through the controls in the last column of the GridView.&nbsp; Now the last column is going to be the CommandField, so I know that there will be some commandcontrols in there.&nbsp; At this point I should not care whether it is a Button, an LinkButton, or an ImageButton because I will be treating them all the same:&nbsp; I will compare their <em>CommandName</em> properties<em> </em>to see what they are doing.&nbsp; So why can&rsquo;t I just cast the control as Button?&nbsp; Well ImageButton doesn&rsquo;t even derive from Button!&nbsp; I am sure there are reasons for that, but I don&rsquo;t see them.&nbsp; This means I have to recompile my code if some UI guy decides they want a link instead of an image for their Edit command.&nbsp; Dumb, I say.&nbsp; An ImageButton, by nature, is a button, not an image.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s behavior is a button.&nbsp; The way we treat it as developers is just like a button.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s <em>view</em> or <em>representation</em> however is an Image, just like a standard button has a raised, rounded rectange as its <em>view.</em>&nbsp; Someone please explain to me why I&rsquo;m wrong&hellip;.</p>
