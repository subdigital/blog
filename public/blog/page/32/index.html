  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I noticed how non-intuitive it is to write to the configuration file programatically for an application.&nbsp; What I needed to do was dynamically create a connection string, then write it to the app.config file.</p>


<p>Here’s how you do it:</p>


<p>first, you need to add a project reference to the <strong>System.Configuration </strong>assembly.&nbsp; Add a corresponding using clause to the top of your class.</p>


<div style="border: 1px solid rgb(102, 102, 102); background: white none repeat scroll 0% 50%; overflow: auto; font-size: 9pt; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; color: black; font-family: Courier New;"><span style="color: rgb(43, 145, 175);">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="color: blue;">using</span> System.Configuration;</div>


<p>Next you need to find and open the configuration file.&nbsp; In win forms, you do this by specifying the full path to your application’s executable.&nbsp; If you project is at <strong>c:\code\project1</strong> then you would pass in something like this: “<strong>c:\code\project1\bin\debug\project1.exe</strong>”.</p>


<div style="border: 1px solid rgb(102, 102, 102); background: white none repeat scroll 0% 50%; overflow: auto; font-size: 9pt; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; color: black; font-family: Courier New;"><p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: rgb(43, 145, 175);">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: teal;">Configuration</span> config = <span style="color: teal;">ConfigurationManager</span>.OpenExeConfiguration(FULL_EXE_PATH);</p><p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: rgb(43, 145, 175);">&nbsp;</span></p><p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: rgb(43, 145, 175);"></span><span style="color: teal;">&nbsp;ConnectionStringSettings</span> connStringSettings = <span style="color: blue;">new</span> <span style="color: teal;">ConnectionStringSettings</span>(<span style="color: maroon;">&#8220;database&#8221;</span>, </p><p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: maroon;"><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>&#8220;connection_string_here&#8221;</span>);</p><p style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: rgb(43, 145, 175);">&nbsp;</span>config.ConnectionStrings.ConnectionStrings.Add(connStringSettings);</p><p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: rgb(43, 145, 175);">&nbsp;</span></p><p style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: rgb(43, 145, 175);"></span>&nbsp;config.Save();</p></div>


<p>For ASP.NET, you can follow the same principle, but use the <strong>System.Web.Configuration</strong> namespace in conjunction with WebConfigurationManager.OpenWebConfiguration(<em>path</em>) where <em>path </em>is the url of your root, for example <em>http://localhost/webapp1</em>&nbsp;(notice there is no trailing slash).</p>

<p>I just finished reading this book by Eric Evans on &ldquo;Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software.&rdquo;&nbsp; Domain Driven Design should really be required reading in college, in my opinion.&nbsp; Eric Evans has a way of describing benefits of rich modeling techniques and how to develop them.&nbsp; He guides you through&nbsp;learning to develop the&nbsp;<em>ubiquitous language</em> of the domain, an important concept for effective modeling.&nbsp; He also&nbsp;addresses many common concerns&nbsp;such as scalability with the techniques in the book.</p>


<p>This isn&rsquo;t your typical software book, chock full of simple examples to help make the author&rsquo;s point.&nbsp; Evans goes into enourmous detail on the examples and builds on them throughout the course of the book.&nbsp; The quality of the examples are what pushes the reader&rsquo;s understanding of the topic to a level that words cannot do alone.</p>


<p>Evans tends to be a bit wordy in this book, and you&rsquo;ll often find that he seems to be repeating himself, frequently with the same verbage.&nbsp; The message is important though, worth visiting more than once.&nbsp; </p>


<p>Domain Driven Design is among the most profound, impacting, and inspiring software books I have ever read.&nbsp; I give it a 5/5.</p>

<p>Set aside for a second that it&rsquo;s a bad representation of the product, there&rsquo;s already a .NET Framework 3.0 in the works and <em>WinFX isn&rsquo;t it!</em>&nbsp; WinFX runs under CLR 2.0.&nbsp; They should call it .NET Framework 2.5 or something.&nbsp; WinFX will not include 3.0 features, such as LINQ.</p>


<p>Why, oh why, Microsoft?</p>


<p>WinFX was a cool name, and developers who were confused about the role of .NET in WinFX should just google it and read a tad.&nbsp; It won&rsquo;t kill you I promise.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I haven&rsquo;t posted in a while, but I had to take 5 and post this today.</p>


<p>I stumbled across yet another fantastic plugin for Firefox today.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s called <a href="http://www.getfirebug.com/" target="_blank">Firebug</a>&nbsp; and it rocks.</p>


<p>If you&rsquo;ve used <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/venkman/" target="_blank">Venkman</a> before, you will appreciate this.&nbsp; Basically it&rsquo;s a complete Javascript debugger + DOM inspector embedded in Firefox. Here&rsquo;s a <a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2006/05/30/hewitt-firebug/" target="_blank">video</a> of it in use.</p>


<p>Life in the web development world suddenly got just a bit sweeter.</p>


<p><img src="/images/48_firebug_2Ddebugger_.png" alt="48_firebug-debugger"  border="0"  /></p>


<p>On a side note, why are there so many good web developer tools for Firefox, and the ones for IE leave something to be desired?</p>

<p>Venkat Subramanium is an amazing speaker.&nbsp; I was fortunate enough to have him as my professor in college and what I remember most are the interesting analogies that helped explain tough topics.</p>


<p>His latest post, <a href="http://www.agiledeveloper.com/blog/" target="_blank">Walking along the developer beach</a>, is another gem that explains the rhythm that you must get in to gain the most productivity out of test-driven development (and test-2nd development).&nbsp; The most interesting thing is that it works for either school.&nbsp; Either you write the test first, then the method, or you write the method first, but immediately after you write your test.&nbsp; It forces you to hold the caller&rsquo;s perspective and not get buried in the code.&nbsp; A byproduct is cleaner, more testable code.</p>


<p>If you are writing unit tests, then that&rsquo;s a huge step that most people aren&rsquo;t even achieving yet, but to get the most out of them, write them in parallel with your methods.&nbsp; Otherwise you&rsquo;ll be hopping along one foot, just like hopskotch.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At Software Architects, when I&rsquo;m not on a project, I am encouraged to seek certifications.&nbsp; These certifications help their partnership with Microsoft and they help us build our résumés.&nbsp; Since my hire date of Febuary 1st, I have completed:</p>


<ul><li>Microsoft Certified Professional</li><li>Microsoft Certified Application Developer</li><li>Microsoft Certified Solution Developer</li><li>Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist (new 2.0 exams)</li></ul>


<p>I probably would not have sought getting certified if my employer hadn&rsquo;t paid for it, but I&rsquo;m glad I did.&nbsp; </p>


<p><em>Note:&nbsp; the following is my personal view of the Microsoft Certification process.&nbsp; I have not taken any Sun/Cisco/A+/or PMP exams, so I&rsquo;m not sure how they stack up.</em></p>


<p>Certifications alone will not take you very far.&nbsp; They do not show that you know how to utilize a particular technology.&nbsp; They do not show that you have ANY experience in a particular technology.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d also dare to say that they can be obtained only by studying tests, not actual concepts.&nbsp; </p>


<p>But, combine them with significant experience building software, and you have solid evidence that a particular person not only knows the technology, but also knows how to apply it on real software.&nbsp; </p>


<p>If I were reviewing résumés, I wouldn&rsquo;t put very much weight in the fact that someone has certifications.&nbsp; If that was ALL that they had, I&rsquo;d consider it negatively.&nbsp; The only certification I would really put stock into is the Microsoft Certified Architect, where you are presented a problem, and you have to submit your architecture to a panel of well-known, high-echelon developers for review.&nbsp; The only downside is that <strong>it costs $10,000</strong>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think my employer will be paying for that any time soon&hellip;</p>

<p>Programmers are good at programming.&nbsp; The time they spend learning tasks extraneous to their day-to-day skills is time not improving the developmental skills.&nbsp; I believe in being multi-faceted, but your developers shouldn&rsquo;t also be your system administrators.&nbsp; Your developers shouldn&rsquo;t spend time assembling desks or ordering/building computers.&nbsp; <strong>Taking your developers off of their high priority tasks to do phone tech support is a waste of his/her time</strong>.&nbsp; High morale and few distractions will lead to better software in the end.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A lot of times when starting a new project you get fairly far into coding before realizing that you might need tools like source control or a flexible build system.</p>


<p>This article will outline what is sometimes called &ldquo;Iteration Zero,&rdquo; which is the step in which you setup your development environment.&nbsp; </p>


<p><em>Keep in mind that these are just suggestions (by me)&nbsp;for a healthy project environment, not a cure-all for development.&nbsp; Each team will (should) have a unified process that everyone agrees on.&nbsp; Hap-hazard development with little support for teams can put a burden on your developers and put the project in jeopardy.</em></p>


<p><strong>Step 1:&nbsp; Choose a source control provider</strong></p>


<p>Even when doing pet-project and single-man projects, you need source control.&nbsp; Let me repeat this.&nbsp; <strong>You need source control</strong>.&nbsp; There are many to choose from, and they are generally easy to use.&nbsp; I personally use <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_blank">Subversion</a>.&nbsp; It is free, comes with a ton of features, and is easily used through the right-click explorer icons.&nbsp; I would warn against Visual SourceSafe for large projects, but for smaller projects it&rsquo;s not that bad and is tightly integrated with Visual Studio.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d recommend Subversion (or SVN for short), <a title="CVS Wiki" href="http://ximbiot.com/cvs/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page" target="_blank">CVS</a>, or <a title="Peforce" href="http://www.perforce.com/" target="_blank">Perforce </a>(which is not free).&nbsp; This article will focus on SVN, since it is what I use most.</p>


<p>I typically create a <em>sandbox</em> folder, where all projects under source control reside.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a look at my current sandbox:</p>


<p><img alt="CropperCapture[4]" src="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/CropperCapture%5B4%5D_small2.jpg" align="left" border="1" / /></p>


<p>As you can see here, I have about 5 projects, with various icons on the folders indicating their status.&nbsp; This is provided through <a title="TortoiseSVN" href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/" target="_blank">TortoiseSVN</a>, an explorer shell add-in.&nbsp; TortoiseSVN adds these context menu items you can see here where I right-clicked on the screen.&nbsp; From here I can checkout projects that reside in the subversion repository.</p>


<p>On projects with distributed teams, you can install Apache and use a WebDAV module to allow HTTP access to the repository.&nbsp; As long as you use SSL and a password file, you&rsquo;ll be secure.&nbsp; There is a free online book available <a title="Free Subversion book" href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.0/" target="_blank">here</a>&nbsp;that has some good information on how to set this up.</p>


<p>So I&rsquo;m going to navigate to my subversion folder (NOT my sandbox) and create a new repository for our sample project.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s call it <em>FinanceAssistant</em>.&nbsp; First, we have to create the directory that will hold the repository.&nbsp; Next,&nbsp;I right-click on our new folder and select &ldquo;Create Repository Here.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>&nbsp;Here you have a choice between a Native File System and&nbsp;a Berkeley database.&nbsp; I have heard that there are no real advantages to using a BDB, though there are some constraints.&nbsp; Just about everyone suggests using a Native File System repository.<img alt="CropperCapture[7]" src="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/CropperCapture%5B7%5D_small1.jpg" align="left" border="1" / />&nbsp; Once this is complete, your repository is ready for checkouts.</p>


<p>The next thing I suggest is to create three folders:</p>


<div><figure role=code><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>/trunk//tags//branches/</div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>


<p>This is a crucial step in effectively utilizing the power of a source control provider. Basically all of your development goes underneath the <em>trunk</em> folder. When you think you are ready for a first-release to your customers, you can <em>Tag</em> the release, which will basically take a snapshot of the current state of the project and stick it into a folder underneath the <em>tags</em> directory. If any bugs are found in the tag release, then they are fixed and <em>merged</em> back into the trunk so future versions get the fix. If any experimental development goes on (like upgrading to a new 3rd party dll version, or some major re-work or refactoring) then you can <em>branch</em> the project. This avoids the problem of having one developers experimentation negatively affect the entire team. Here&#8217;s how our project might look: </p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p></p>


<div><figure role=code><div class="highlight"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code' width='100%'><pre><code class=''><div class='line'>/branches&lt;br /> /ExperimentalBranch1&lt;br />&lt;br />/tags&lt;br /> /0.4&lt;br /> /0.64&lt;br /> /0.85&lt;br /> /1.0&lt;br /> /1.4&lt;br />&lt;br />/trunk&lt;br />/src&lt;br /></div></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></div>


<p></p>


<p>What&#8217;s great about this approach is that you can, at any time, checkout a specific version of your project that may have been in the past. Everything that was included in source control will return to the state it was in at the revision you specify. This can really help at times, especially if you have customers using old or different versions of your software and are reporting bugs.&nbsp; The first step is to create the three base directories.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s do this via the Repository Browser in TortoiseSVN.&nbsp; Right-click anywhere in explorer and go to <strong>TortoiseSVN-&gt;Repo-Browser</strong>.&nbsp; Enter in the path to your repository, which in my case will be this:&nbsp; <em>file:///e:/svn/FinanceAssistant/</em> (notice the unix/web style path)</p>


<p>. From here I can create the folders that I talked about. Once I have them created, I am ready to check out the trunk to start developing. You definitely don&#8217;t want to have this entire structure checked out at once. You might inadvertently modify a file that isn&#8217;t under active development. </p>


<p>I&rsquo;ll now go to my sandbox folder and checkout the project by right-clicking explorer.&nbsp; Notice how I&rsquo;m checkout out the <em>trunk</em> subdirectory, not the root of the repository.</p>


<p><img alt="CropperCapture[9]" src="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/CropperCapture%5B9%5D_small1.jpg" align="left" border="1" / /></p>


<p>There are many options to choose from while checking out a project.&nbsp; Here I can choose a specific revision # to checkout from.&nbsp; This is good if a developer checks in some breaking changes and you need to roll-back to a revision that was working.</p>


<p>This will create the working folder in our sandbox.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll notice that any directory under source control will have a hidden folder called &ldquo;<em>.svn&rdquo;.&nbsp; </em>The period in front of the <em>svn</em> wreaks havoc with FrontPage Server Extensions with Visual Studio 2003.&nbsp; ASP.NET 1.1 projects will need to look for a specific version of TortoiseSVN that uses a &ldquo;<em>_svn</em>&rdquo; directory instead.&nbsp; For Visual Studio 2005 we don&rsquo;t have this problem.</p>


<p>So now we have our working folder, ready for development.&nbsp; After we make changes to the contents of this folder, we must <em>Commit</em> the changes.&nbsp; When we want to get the latest changes from the server, we <em>Update</em> our working copy.</p>


<p>So at the beginning of every day, we should <em>Update</em> our working copy to get the latest changes.&nbsp; We then will make changes until they are stable and pass tests.&nbsp; After this we <em>Commit</em> the changes so that other developers receive them.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s important not to let your project get too out-of-sync with the repository.&nbsp; It is worse, however, to commit changes that break the build and prevent other developers from being productive.&nbsp; If any two files are modified and checked in at the same time, subversion will do a simple merge and ask the developer to verify the changes using a Diff Viewer.</p>


<p>Using a source control system is a <strong>critical</strong> step that many small shops just don&rsquo;t do.&nbsp; The risks are enormous if a disk fails or if developers overwrite each other&rsquo;s changes.&nbsp; </p>


<p>Here are some more resources on using Subversion:</p>


<ul><li><a title="Free Subversion eb
ook" href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/" target="_blank">The free ebook</a>.&nbsp; This was my first resource for using Subversion.&nbsp; It is pretty concise and will answer many beginner questions.</li><li><a title="Pragmatic Version Control with Subversion" href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/svn/" target="_blank">Pragmatic Version Control with Subversion</a>&nbsp;by Mike Mason.&nbsp; This book is a good complement to the free ebook.&nbsp; It is short and has good examples in the book.</li><li><a title="TortoiseSVN" href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/" target="_blank">TortoiseSVN</a>.&nbsp; My favorite SVN client.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very easy to use and is updated pretty regularly.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s just like <a title="TortoiseCVS" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tortoisecvs" target="_blank">TortoiseCVS</a>.</li><li><a title="AnkhSVN" href="http://ankhsvn.tigris.org/" target="_blank">AnkhSVN</a>.&nbsp; Visual Studio 2003 integration with SVN.&nbsp; It works pretty well, but I still fall back on Tortoise for some tasks.&nbsp; No support for Visual Studio 2005 yet.</li></ul>


<p>In step 2, we&rsquo;ll take a look at a slightly different project directory structure than you&rsquo;re probably used to.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll also talk about NAnt as a build tool&nbsp;to support this structure.&nbsp; Until next time&hellip;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>People who know me can tell you that I have about zero patience for software.&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially software that is so integral to my day-to-day use of the computer.</p>


<p>One such program is my media player.&nbsp; I have tried pretty much every single one out there, and I haven&rsquo;t been too impressed with any of them.&nbsp; I constantly evaluate these programs and usually just end up settling.&nbsp; </p>


<p><em>(I should also note that I&rsquo;m probably the only person on the planet that doesn&rsquo;t have an iPod.&nbsp; Heck, </em><a title="pope has an ipod" href="http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0601282.htm" target="new"><em>even the Pope has one</em></a><em>!)</em></p>


<ul><li><strong>Windows Media Player &ndash; </strong>The library integration is weak and not very usable for me.&nbsp; The built-in cd burner is piss-poor, and I generally don&rsquo;t like the interface.&nbsp; I usually just use this for viewing temporary media (like my phone&rsquo;s voicemail or little video clips).&nbsp;&nbsp;The built-in taskbar toolbar is KICKASS and more media players should do this.</li><li><strong>WinAMP</strong> &ndash; Fantastic for a file-based collection, but I have grown to need more.&nbsp; My library was out of control and I was tired of manually tagging/renaming.&nbsp; The media library didn&rsquo;t suit me.&nbsp; The visualizations are top-notch and the skin community is HUGE.&nbsp; I like the interface, but again, I needed more control over my library.</li><li><strong>MusicMatch </strong>&ndash; As much as I&rsquo;d like this one to work for me, it still didn&rsquo;t feel right.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t get a good view of my music, and I was sick of it trying to get me to subscribe to it&rsquo;s mp3 download service.&nbsp; I uninstalled it.</li><li><strong>iTunes &ndash; </strong>I have chosen to stick with this one for now.&nbsp; The interface is pretty well thought-out and I really like the smart playlists.&nbsp; The ability to share music on the local network is very nice, though I&rsquo;d like this to be able to stream over the internet as well (authenticated, of course).&nbsp; It has decent support for podcast subscriptions, though a bit-torrent-aware plugin would be nice for this.&nbsp; I also like the ability to rate songs easily.</li></ul>


<p>I gathered some tips on generating some good smart playlists from <a title="andy budd's blogography" href="http://www.andybudd.com/archives/2005/08/itunes_smart_playlists/index.php" target="_blank">Andy Budd</a>.&nbsp; Basically this keeps my playlists <em>alive</em> and I can rate songs to help shape the playlists.&nbsp; I can un-check songs that I don&rsquo;t want to be included in ANY playlist (like stand-up comedy, podcasts,&nbsp;or 0:20 long tracks that are skits or preludes to other songs on the same cd).</p>


<p>So now that the media situation was settled, I needed a nice way to keep my music in sync from my desktop and laptop (at work).&nbsp; I&rsquo;d still like streaming ability over the internet, but these are the machines I use most, so they&rsquo;ll have to do.&nbsp; At the advice of <a title="computer zen" href="http://www.computerzen.com/" target="_blank">Scott Hanselman</a>&nbsp;I decided to give <a title="foldershare" href="https://www.foldershare.com/" target="_blank">FolderShare</a> another go.&nbsp; This time around I noticed that 2 things changed:</p>


<ul><li>Microsoft bought them out</li><li>Now it&rsquo;s FREE!</li></ul>


<p>This definitely got me interested.&nbsp; I decided to setup my mp3 folder as my share folder and installed FolderShare on both PCs.&nbsp; When I get new music in, I import it using iTunes (which copies and renames the files) and will automatically be synchronized with the other PC.&nbsp; That means I can import music on either my laptop or my desktop and everything will stay organized.&nbsp; This is a big plus for me.</p>


<p>So far this is working out fairly well.&nbsp; If I rename or change the tag of a file, then the whole file has to be transferred back to the other PC, so this can use up quite a bit of bandwidth.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t run into any issues with this so far.</p>


<p>Some other cool music links are:</p>


<ul><li><a title="musicbrainz" href="http://musicbrainz.org/" target="_blank">MusicBrainz Tagger</a> &ndash; This open-source free service is a GREAT idea.&nbsp; Basically it will scan your mp3&rsquo;s, make a digital footprint of each one, then try to match it with the online database.&nbsp; It will give you a percentage of confidence so you can setup to automatically tag those files that are 90% or greater and sift through the ones it wasn&rsquo;t sure about.&nbsp; If it cannot find a match, it will ask you to help the community out and supply some tag info.&nbsp; This can run in the background to automatically organize your mp3s.&nbsp; Very cool.</li><li><a title="itunes registry" href="http://www.itunesregistry.com/" target="_blank">iTunes Registry</a>&nbsp;&ndash; Upload your iTunes playlists and get suggestions based on data from the other uploaded playlists.&nbsp; See what other people are listening to.</li><li><a href="http://www.musicmobs.com/">music mobs</a>&nbsp;&ndash; Mark songs that you like and see what other people suggest.</li></ul>


<p>Are there any other helpful media links that I might add here?</p>


<p><strong><font color="#ff0000">UPDATE:</font>&nbsp; </strong>I recently saw some issues when synchronizing the folders that iTunes manages on both ends.&nbsp; If one iTunes collection modifies a filename or adds a file to the list, the 2nd iTunes will not pick it up, since I am not sync&rsquo;ing the iTunes .xml files.&nbsp; To fix this, I found a script that will scan your folder and re-import all of the songs.&nbsp; Best of all, this will&nbsp;*not* reset your playcounts, ratings,&nbsp;or tag info.&nbsp; This includes songs that were not already in your library, so it&rsquo;s perfect for me.&nbsp; If you use it, make sure and edit it to include your music directory.</p>


<p><a title="iTunes folder sync script" href="http://waves.ky/iTunes/iTunesFolderSync.js" target="_blank">Click here for the iTunes Folder Sync script.</a>&nbsp; Thanks to Garreth Farrington for this.&nbsp; (Anybody want to wrap this script in an easier-to-use app?)</p>
