Here are some of the personal projects I have built.

* ### [NSScreencast](http://nsscreencast.com)
  Quality, bite-sized screencasts for iOS Development.

* ### [Side Mirror](http://sidemirrorapp.com)
  An app for presenters who do live demos on a Mac.

* ### [GiggleTouch](http://giggletouch.com)
  A universal iOS app for toddlers, where touches spawn shapes & letters of various colors
  and laughter keeps the kiddos entertained.

* ### [NSDateFormatter.com](http://nsdateformatter.com)
  I created this website as a useful resource for iOS developers to quickly
  lookup and test format strings for parsing dates & times. It was heavily inspired
  by [foragoodstrftime](http://foragoodstrftime.com) in the Ruby world. This site
  was built with open-source Swift and deployed to Linux. It is also [open-source](https://github.com/subdigital/nsdateformatter.com).
