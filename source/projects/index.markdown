Here are some of the personal projects I have built.

* ### [NSScreencast](http://nsscreencast.com)
  Quality, bite-sized screencasts for iOS Development.

* ### [Side Mirror](http://sidemirrorapp.com)
  An app for presenters who do live demos on a Mac.

* ### [GiggleTouch](http://giggletouch.com)
  A universal iOS app for toddlers, where touches spawn shapes & letters of various colors
  and laughter keeps the kiddos entertained.
