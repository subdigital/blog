Here are some of the personal projects I have built.

* ### [NSScreencast](http://nsscreencast.com)
  Quality, bite-sized screencasts for iOS Development.

* ### [AppKickstand](http://appkickstand.com)
  Set up a free website for your iPhone app.

* ### [GiggleTouch](http://giggletouch.com)
  A universal iOS app for toddlers, where touches spawn shapes & letters of various colors
  and laughter keeps the kiddos entertained.
