<p>
I'm always eager to create things. Here are some of the personal projects I have built.

  </h3>
  <p class="Project__description">
    Quality, bite-sized screencasts for iOS Development. I've been recording NSScreencast videos for over 5 years now, releasing a new video each week. The site is built with Ruby on Rails, uses <a href="https://stripe.com" target="_blank">Stripe</a> to process payments. I also released an iOS app and tvOS app.

    <a href="http://sidemirrorapp.com">Side Mirror</a>
  </h3>
  <p class="Project__description">
    An app for presenters who do live demos on a Mac. It shows you what is mirrored on the projector in a small window on your main screen so that you can avoid from ever looking back at the projector to see what's being displayed there.

  </h3>
  <p class="Project__description">
  A universal iOS app for toddlers, where touches spawn shapes &amp; letters of various colors
  and laughter keeps the kiddos entertained. I originally built this in 2010 for my (then) twin toddlers. I then rebuilt it in 2014 using SpriteKit with better graphics and sounds.

  <p class="Project__description">
  I created this website as a useful resource for iOS developers to quickly
  lookup and test format strings for parsing dates &amp; times. It was heavily inspired
  by <a href="http://foragoodstrftime.com" target="_blank">foragoodstrftime</a> in the Ruby world. This site
  was built with open-source Swift and deployed to Heroku. It is also <a href="https://github.com/subdigital/nsdateformatter.com" target="_blank">open-source</a>.

    This is a podcast I created along with Daniel Pasco to talk about guitars. We were having regular chats anyway, so we decided to make it a podcast form.
