<p>The book will not be your typical introductory text. &nbsp;Instead, we're focusing on realistic usage, such as encouraging &amp; facilitating test-driven development, leveraging inversion of control frameworks, and adhering to good software development principles like Single Responsibility.</p>
<p>You can take a look at our sample application for the book, <a target="_blank" href="http://codecampserver.org">Code Camp Server</a>.</p>
