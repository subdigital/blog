<p>The other day, my cube-mate <a href="http://pseale.com/blog" target="_blank">Peter Seale</a>, posed the following question:</p><blockquote>Do you ever wonder why the Experts Exchange website url has a dash in it? </blockquote><p>Well, no I didn't before... but I now I am... why? (at this moment I pause for a second and think about what the url would be... )</p><p><strong>expertsexchange dot com</strong></p><p>That just might send the wrong message... whaddyathink?</p>
