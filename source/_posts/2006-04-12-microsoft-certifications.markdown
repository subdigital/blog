<p>At Software Architects, when I&rsquo;m not on a project, I am encouraged to seek certifications.&nbsp; These certifications help their partnership with Microsoft and they help us build our résumés.&nbsp; Since my hire date of Febuary 1st, I have completed:</p><ul><li>Microsoft Certified Professional</li><li>Microsoft Certified Application Developer</li><li>Microsoft Certified Solution Developer</li><li>Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist (new 2.0 exams)</li></ul><p>I probably would not have sought getting certified if my employer hadn&rsquo;t paid for it, but I&rsquo;m glad I did.&nbsp; </p><p><em>Note:&nbsp; the following is my personal view of the Microsoft Certification process.&nbsp; I have not taken any Sun/Cisco/A+/or PMP exams, so I&rsquo;m not sure how they stack up.</em></p><p>Certifications alone will not take you very far.&nbsp; They do not show that you know how to utilize a particular technology.&nbsp; They do not show that you have ANY experience in a particular technology.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d also dare to say that they can be obtained only by studying tests, not actual concepts.&nbsp; </p><p>But, combine them with significant experience building software, and you have solid evidence that a particular person not only knows the technology, but also knows how to apply it on real software.&nbsp; </p><p>If I were reviewing résumés, I wouldn&rsquo;t put very much weight in the fact that someone has certifications.&nbsp; If that was ALL that they had, I&rsquo;d consider it negatively.&nbsp; The only certification I would really put stock into is the Microsoft Certified Architect, where you are presented a problem, and you have to submit your architecture to a panel of well-known, high-echelon developers for review.&nbsp; The only downside is that <strong>it costs $10,000</strong>.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think my employer will be paying for that any time soon&hellip;</p>
