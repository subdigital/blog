<p>For those of you near Houston, I will be speaking about advanced CSS and javascript techniques on June 14<sup>th</sup>.</p><p>The Houston .NET User Group is located in Westchase.&nbsp; For more info, see their website at <a href="http://hdnug.org/">http://hdnug.org</a>.</p><p>My presentation will cover some of the foundations of CSS-based web development and what it means to develop with web standards in mind.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll also take a look at how to apply JavaScript in a safe and effective way to ensure that we still function when JavaScript is disabled, but also to allow the rest of the world to enjoy a richer web browsing experience.&nbsp; If there&rsquo;s time towards the end, we&rsquo;ll also see how this applies to ajax.</p><p>Hope to see you there!</p>
