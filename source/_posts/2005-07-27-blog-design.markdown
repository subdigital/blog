<p>I had my blog redesigned by Bob Yu, our lead designer at LyntonWeb.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s really sharp, and a whiz with just about any design program he gets his hands on.&nbsp; He also helped me get the css to play nice in both browsers, but we&rsquo;re still ironing out wrinkles.</p><p>You can check his work out at <a href="http://bpd.plantedtank.net/" target="_blank">http://bpd.plantedtank.net</a>.&nbsp; Shoot him an email if you&rsquo;d like to hire him.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a good guy.</p><p>So, what do you think of my new look?</p>
