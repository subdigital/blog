<p>I&rsquo;m starting to scratch the massive surface that is CAB.&nbsp; CAB is better known as the Composite UI Application Block developed by the Patterns &amp; Practices Group at Microsoft.</p><p>It&rsquo;s hard to define exactly what CAB gives you in one sentence, but I&rsquo;ll try.&nbsp; How about <em>manageable windows forms architecture with an emphasis on patterns </em>?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m an ASP.NET guy, so that&rsquo;s where my expertise lies, however I have built a few moderately sized WinForms apps and they get unwieldy very quickly.</p><p>I plan on posting a bit about CAB as I dig into it, so stay tuned for that.&nbsp; For now I&rsquo;ll just post my first experience with it:&nbsp; Getting the darn thing installed.&nbsp; In tune with many CTP and early release software, it doesn&rsquo;t always go as smoothly as planned.</p><p>First thing to do is install the following things <strong>in the correct order</strong>:<br />(<em>I assume you already have .NET 2.0 and Visual Studio 2005 installed)</em></p><ul><li><a title="Microsoft - Download GAX" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=C0A394C0-5EEB-47C4-9F7B-71E51866A7ED&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank">Guidance Automation Extensions</a></li><li><a title="Microsoft - Download GAT" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=E3D101DB-6EE1-4EC5-884E-97B27E49EAAE&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank">Guidance Automation Toolkit for Visual Studio 2005</a></li><li><a title="Microsoft - Download CAB" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=7b9ba1a7-dd6d-4144-8ac6-df88223aee19&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank">Composite UI Application Block (CAB)</a></li><li><a title="Microsoft - Download EntLib" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=5a14e870-406b-4f2a-b723-97ba84ae80b5&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank">Enterprise Library (June 2006)</a></li></ul><p>I found some sources on the internet that listed those in reverse, and I got an error at the Guidance Automation Toolkit installation that said &ldquo;<em>Operation invalid for the current state of the object</em>.&rdquo;</p><p>In my case, I got the error even after uninstalling them all, but I was able to fix the error by modifying the registry.&nbsp; Open <em>regedit<strong> </strong></em>and navigate to <em>HKEY LOCAL MACHINE\SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\COMMAND PROCESSOR\.</em>&nbsp; There should be a key in there called <em>AutoRun</em>.&nbsp; I renamed this to <em>AutoRunOld</em> and the installation worked.</p><p>(I have a feeling that this setting was modified by an XPize installation, since they modify your command prompt settings&hellip; but I haven&rsquo;t confirmed this.)</p><p>Now that everything is installed and running, check out these resources to get your feet wet with CAB:</p><ul><li><a title="Bill Simser's blog (CAB)" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/bsimser/archive/tags/CAB/default.aspx" target="_blank">Bill Simser&rsquo;s blog</a> has a few nice gems about CAB</li><li><a title=".NET Developer's Journal article" href="http://dotnet.sys-con.com/read/133764.htm" target="_blank">A First Look at CAB</a> at .NET Developer&rsquo;s Journal</li><li><a title="Microsoft Whitepaper PDF" href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/0/3/103adb7f-1e45-42f8-8696-63e513875258/CAB%20SCSF%20-%20Architecture%20Guidance%20-%20Raiffeisen.pdf" target="_blank">Microsoft Whitepaper on Designing Smart Clients with CAB</a>&nbsp;(PDF)</li><li><a title="CAB Wiki" href="http://cabpedia.com/" target="_blank">CABPedia (wiki)</a></li></ul><p>The next post will definitely contain more &ldquo;meat.&rdquo;</p>
