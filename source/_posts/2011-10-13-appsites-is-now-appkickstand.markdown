A few weeks ago I launched Appsites, a free way to quickly host an
attractive splash page for iPhone applications.

Instead of competing with another site with the same name for traffic
when we could be sharing it, I decided a new name was in order.

**I now present to you:  [AppKickstand](http://appkickstand.com).**

<a href="http://appkickstand.com"><img src="/images/appkickstand.png"
alt="AppKickstand" border="0" /></a>

For an example of what it looks like with real apps, check out
[Giggle Touch](http://appkickstand.com/giggletouch) or
[Tally Things](http://appkickstand.com/tallythings).

If you have an iPhone app, what are you waiting for?  It's **FREE**!
