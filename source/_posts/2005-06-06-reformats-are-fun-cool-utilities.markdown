<div style="clear:both;"></div>Today I reformated my computer at work.It REALLY needed a fix, it was running so slow!<br /><br />Anyway, I got 90% of the things I need installed in 1 day, which is pretty good.Now I'm wondering:I want to make a backup image of this install... should I use Norton Ghost or Acronis TruImage?<br /><br /><br />The first thing I like to do is customize the UI a bit...to do that I first <a href="http://www.belchfire.net/article205.html">patch uxtheme</a>, then I download a nice <a href="http://www.customize.org">visual style & background</a>.<br /><br />So far I am liking Milk, Simple Plan, and of course Water Color.I also found a good milk-look-alike called <a href="http://www.customize.org/details/38285">Kuantum</a> that has extras for the Yz dock.<a href="http://www.majorgeeks.com/download2790.html">Yz dock</a> is a mac-cloned taskbar that auto-magnifies when your mouse rolls over it.I like this thing, and it goes great with <a href="http://www.otakusoftware.com/topdesk/">TopDesk</a>.<br /><br />Anyway, here's a screenshot of the style in action:<br /><a href="http://www.customize.org/view/38285"><br /><img width=410 src="http://images.customize.org/category/stylexp/KuantumVisualStyle1-2_full.gif"><br /></a><br /><br />YZ Dock looks like this:<br /><img width=410 src="http://www.majorgeeks.com/screenshots/y/yzdock.jpg"><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
