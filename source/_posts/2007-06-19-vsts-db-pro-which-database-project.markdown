<p>I installed Visual Studio Team Edition for Database Professionals the other day and I was about to create my first DB Pro project.</p><p>Check out the New Project dialog box.&nbsp; This is with VSTS Developer,&nbsp;and DB Pro installed:</p><p><img src="/images/image001.jpg" alt="Image001"  border="0"  /></p><p>and&hellip;</p><p><img src="/images/image002.jpg" alt="Image002"  border="0"  /></p><p>Seeing as how I never used the standard database project in Visual Studio before, I couldn&rsquo;t tell which one I was supposed to choose.&nbsp; </p><p>It turns out that you need to pick the one in the 2<sup>nd</sup> screenshot, the Microsoft SQL Server project.&nbsp; </p><p>Wasn&rsquo;t very intuitive which project to choose.</p><div class="bjtags">Tags:<a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/VSTS">VSTS</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/DB+Pro">DB+Pro</a></div>
