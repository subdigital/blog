<p>I got the chance to meet an enthusiastic bunch of folks in Austin and Fort Worth this week, and I wrapped up my Texas Tour of MVC.&nbsp; I really want to say thanks to groups for having me.&nbsp; It was a pleasure to speak and connect with fellow developers in Texas.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll be posting a massive recap this week that includes the code and powerpoint that I delivered.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d appreciate any and all feedback.</p><p>Now for that long drive home&hellip;</p>
