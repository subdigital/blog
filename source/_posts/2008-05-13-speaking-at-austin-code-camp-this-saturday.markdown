<p>I must be crazy.&nbsp; I submitted four sessions for Austin Code Camp and they were all accepted!&nbsp; It will be a long weekend for sure.&nbsp; You can find out more details here:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.austincodecamp.com">http://www.austincodecamp.com</a>.</p> <p>If you're going to attend, be sure to hit up one of my talks:</p> <ul> <li>ReSharper-Fu</li> <li>Inversion of Control Quickstart</li> <li>Advanced CSS and Javascript</li> <li>Domain Driven Design w/ NHibernate</li></ul> <p>I'm sure that we'll put together some sort of geek dinner to unwind afterwards.&nbsp; If you're interested, drop me a line in the comments!</p>
