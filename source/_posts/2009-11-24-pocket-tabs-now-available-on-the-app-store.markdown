It took just over 5 weeks to get it approved, but it was worth the wait.

What can you do with it?&#160; With Pocket Tabs you can:

- Save the tabs to your device
- Submit your own tabs to <a href="http://pockettabs.com">http://pockettabs.com</a>
- View your tabs anywhere, anytime
- Turn on Auto-Scrolling for hands-free operation
- Email tabs to your friends

<strong>If you download the app, please submit a review!</strong>

To celebrate the launch, I’d like to hold a little contest.&#160; I’ll give a free Pocket Tabs coupon to the first person who can answer this music trivia correctly:

<h4><em>What lies in the whispering winds?</em></h4>
(nobody said it would be a <em>hard</em> question!)

&#160; Be sure to include your email address in the comment so that I can send you the coupon.
