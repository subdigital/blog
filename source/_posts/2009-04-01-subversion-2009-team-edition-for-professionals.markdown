<p>Today I was on a conference call with an internal Microsoft contact (who I shall not name to protect his livelihood).  Subversion, the popular open source-control client, will announce next week that they are partnering with Microsoft to create an OSS friendly source control provider that leverages many of the benefits of TFS internally.</p>
<p><cite>&quot;It really makes sense for us.  Microsoft's Team Foundation Source control integrates deeply into the IDE, the only editor that developers need.&quot; </cite> -- a Subversion core developer commented</p>
<p>One of the higher-ups that helped finalize the deal was overheard saying, &quot;I think this will finally put a nail in the coffin of other source control systems to create one system to rule them all!&quot;</p>
<p>Some notable changes for the upcoming version:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The check-in/check-out model will be used.</strong> This is because writing code collaboratively is so unbelievably similar to reading books in a library.  That edit-merge-commit model just wasn't working out for anyone anyway.    <br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Local files will be locked by default</strong>.  This allows project owners to keep tabs on who is modifying files at all times.  It also encourages people to take ownership of a module.  Studies show that most people don't understand other people's code, so this will keep others paws out of your module!<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Merging will be made more difficult, to prevent frequent use.</strong>  It was found that merging is painful for folks and thus, they should do it as seldom as possible.<br />
&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>All actions performed within Visual Studio.</strong>  Developers don't use any other editors anyway, and with the ease of developing Visual Studio add-ins, this was a no brainer!  We will not allow any other clients access to prevent confusion.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just some of the features coming out in Subversion Team Edition 2009 for Professionals, and I am excited to use it!</p>
