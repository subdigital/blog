<p>A couple of weeks ago I gave a presentation on Object Relational Mapping with NHibernate.</p><p>We talked about:</p><ul><li>Basic Concepts</li><li>Getting Started, watching what SQL gets generated for various actions</li><li>Architecture, querying, etc</li><li>A live Blog example done with TDD</li></ul><p>A number of people came and watched me drown in code, but I think all-in-all it was a good time and I think I conveyed a lot of information in a small time-frame.</p><p>Anyway, I recorded the presentation.&nbsp; You can download it below.&nbsp; You will need the <a title="Camtasia's video codec download" href="http://www.techsmith.com/download/codecs.asp" target="_blank">TechSmith Video Codec</a> to view it.</p><p>A few times I was asked questions by the audience and I didn&rsquo;t repeat the question, so hopefully you will be able to infer a bit.&nbsp; </p><p>I&rsquo;d appreciate your feedback if you watch it, it&rsquo;s about 1 hour and 45 minutes (ouch!).</p><p><a href="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/ORMWithNHibernateScreenCast.wmv" target="_blank">File Attachment: ORMWithNHibernateScreenCast.wmv (64824 KB)</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
