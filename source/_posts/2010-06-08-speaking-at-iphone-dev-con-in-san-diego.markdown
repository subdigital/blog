<p>I'll be heading to San Diego in September at <a href="http://www.iphonedevcon.com/">iPhone/iPad Dev Con 2010</a>.  I'll be giving two talks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>iPhone SQLite Techniques</strong></li>
<li><strong>iPhone Dev for .NET Developers</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This is a great chance to get some top notch training for iPhone &amp; iPad development.  The conference is from September 27th - 29th.  If you register before June 18th you'll get an early bird discount.  <em>You can also use the coupon code SCHEIRMAN and get an additional $100 off!</em></p>
<p>As someone who is well-versed in the Microsoft ecosystem, it is encouraging to see some of the similar outlets available to iPhone developers.  I'm finding that there are people just as eager to engage with fellow developers, show off something cool, and share their experiences for nothing else but to better the overall community.</p>
