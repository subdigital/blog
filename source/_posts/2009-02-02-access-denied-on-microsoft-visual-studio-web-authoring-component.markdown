<p>I'm finally able to install .NET 3.5 and run Visual Studio 2008 at my client.&nbsp; Yeah, yeah,&nbsp; "<em>Welcome to 2008</em>" I can hear you say.&nbsp; "You're just in time for VS 2010!"&nbsp; I know... but big ships turn slowly :)</p> <p>Anyway, when installing Visual Studio 2008 I was promptly greeted with a slew of errors.&nbsp; Checking the log yielded this not very helpful statement:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>[02/02/09,13:53:22] Microsoft Visual Studio Web Authoring Component: [2] Error code 5 for this component means "Access is denied.</em></p></blockquote> <p>The knowledge base article it linked to was less than helpful as well.&nbsp; A colleague asked me to crack open McAfee's logs and sure enough... we found this in there:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>2/2/2009&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1:41:20 PM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blocked by Access Protection ru&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ZZZ\user&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d:\wcu\webdesignercore\WebDesignerCore.EXE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\7912618bc3a93fed0bab\autorun.inf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; User-defined Rules:Autorun_inf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Action blocked : Create<br>2/2/2009&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1:53:22 PM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blocked by Access Protection rule&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ZZZ\user d:\wcu\webdesignercore\WebDesignerCore.EXE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\e300576fb9ee95c7e7e9c2cb\autorun.inf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; User-defined Rules:Autorun_inf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Action blocked : Create<br>2/2/2009&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2:02:08 PM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blocked by Access Protection rule&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ZZZ\user d:\wcu\webdesignercore\WebDesignerCore.EXE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\9e98c3f777aff7da331d68c05065b5\autorun.inf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; User-defined Rules:Autorun_inf&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Action blocked : Create</em></p></blockquote> <p>That is three separate installation attempts that failed.&nbsp; Luckily my account had the ability to disable the sometimes-annoying-file-blocking-thingy in McAfee Enterprise.</p> <p><img src="/images/mcaffee-file-access-dialog_3_.png" alt="mcaffee-file-access-dialog"  border="0" /> </p> <p>If you're getting this error, try disabling that guy to install Visual Studio.&nbsp; Don't forget to turn it back on though, or the corp network security guys with shotguns might visit your desk wondering why a worm installed on your machine was sending out emails to everyone in the company with a vulgar photo...</p> <p>Hope this saves someone the 30 minutes it cost me today!</p>
