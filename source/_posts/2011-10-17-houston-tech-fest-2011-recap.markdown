Houston Tech Fest 2011 came and went, and yet again was a great success.
I believe it was the biggest one ever, with over 1,300 registrants.

I gave three talks:

* [Rails Intrigue](http://speakerrate.com/talks/8761-rails-intrigue)
* [Introducing a new feature to a Rails app using Cucumber](http://speakerrate.com/talks/8744-introducing-a-new-feature-to-a-rails-app-from-beginning-to-end) (with Claudio Lasalla)
* [Wrangle your source like a boss with git](http://speakerrate.com/talks/8760-wrangle-your-source-like-a-boss-with-git)

You can find the slides & code used in the presentations [here on github](http://github.com/subdigital/houston-tech-fest-2011).

If you attended any of these sessions, I'd really appreciate if you
rate them using the links above.

See you next year, Houston Tech Fest!
