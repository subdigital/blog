<div style="clear:both;"></div>I am really liking rentacoder.com(why didn't I find this sooner?)....it's nice to be able to make a few hundred extra dollars per month for doing what I love:coding.<br /><br />My only issues are that the RAC fee is huge, and that when they pay me, Paypal takes a tiny bit as well!Good god, by the time I get my money it will have diminished almost 20%!<br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
