<p>Well my webhost crashed and I lost a month of posts.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m trying to see if I can find a more recent backup, but for now this will have to do.</p><p>I moved over to webhost4life.&nbsp; They have pretty good hosting for $10/month for:</p><ul><li>asp.net 2.0</li><li>sql server 2000</li><li>sql server 2005</li><li>mail</li></ul><p>The only downside is that you have to pay $15/year for each domain that points to a folder other than your root.&nbsp; So if you have 2 sites, you&rsquo;ll have to put them in their own subdirectory, and pay a little extra to get the domain to point there.</p><p>Still not a bad deal for 2 sites, $150 for a year, including mail.</p>
