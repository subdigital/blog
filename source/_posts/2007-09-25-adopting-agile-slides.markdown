<p>Agile Houston tonight was a pretty good turn out. There were over 30 people, so it was a good number to get people talking.&nbsp; If you came, I&rsquo;d love to hear your feedback in the comments!</p><p>I was able to talk to a number of agile folks from Houston and it&rsquo;s really cool to see this type of enthusiasm at a local level.</p><p>You can download the slides <a href="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/adopting-agile.zip" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p>(Matt recorded the whole thing, so if I can get the audio bits I&rsquo;ll post those as well).</p>
