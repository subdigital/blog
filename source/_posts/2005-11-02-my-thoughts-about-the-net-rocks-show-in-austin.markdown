&nbsp; <p>I&rsquo;m listening to .NET Rocks! live in Austin right now (you can download it <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/" target="_blank">here</a>)</p><p>I enjoyed listening to <a href="http://www.jeffreypalermo.com/" target="_blank">Jeffrey Palermo</a> and <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/sbellware/" target="_blank">Scott Bellware</a>, as I read their blogs often.</p><p>I&rsquo;d just like to vent about this moron:</p><p><img height="102" alt="Leeman" src="http://ben.lyntonweb.com/blog/uploads/leeman_small.jpg" width="128" border="1" /></p><p>.. who said &ldquo;C# Sucks!&rdquo; live on the air.&nbsp; His name is Leeman Schmitt.&nbsp; Obviously this guy is incredibly narrow-minded, and cannot easily understand (let alone take advantage of) the differences and superiorities of another language.&nbsp; VB.NET, while a great language, is not the panacea of development.&nbsp; I get completely annoyed when someone is tied so tightly to ONE particular viewpoint on a problem.</p><p>I believe it was Scott Hanselman who said, <em>&ldquo;C# and VB.NET are just different flavors of IL&rdquo; &ndash;&nbsp; </em>I couldn&rsquo;t agree with this more.</p><p>Given the choice, I will choose C# because that&rsquo;s what I prefer.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t push it on anyone else, I don&rsquo;t claim that it&rsquo;s the best, or that everything else sucks.&nbsp; I am perfectly happy to work on a project in VB.NET because I am versatile.&nbsp; I would be happy to use PHP or Ruby, or JSP for that matter, since I believe being multi-faceted benefits my work in ALL languages.</p><p>I have been hearing a lot of this whiny attitude toward C# lately.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t hire anyone if they couldn&rsquo;t program comfortably in VB.NET <strong>and</strong> C#.&nbsp; I would also frown upon anyone who would just JUMP to using a particular technology for every problem they come across.</p><p>Anyway, I cast my blogvote to C#, thought I still respect any language or tool that will help me work productively.&nbsp; </p><p>Ok, I&rsquo;m done ranting&hellip;&nbsp; flame on <img src="http://ben.lyntonweb.com/blog/uploads/smile1.gif" /></p><p><strong>Ed:</strong> <em>Ok, so I was a little harsh.&nbsp; Apparently there was more to this story.&nbsp; So Leeman, no offense&hellip;&nbsp; I just get really worked up about this topic <img src="http://ben.lyntonweb.com/blog/uploads/smile1.gif" /></em></p>
