In the interest of getting better at marketing the things I am a part of, I’d like to formally introduce you to a labor of love I created with [Daniel Pasco](http://twitter.com/dlpasco) called [Vibrato.fm](http://vibrato.fm).

Vibrato.fm is a podcast focused on all things guitar, gear, and tone. It is hosted by Daniel and myself. We’re 8 episodes in so far, and I’m very proud of it.

Go ahead and [subscribe](http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/299/rss) if you’re into that sort of thing, and of course I’d really love a review on iTunes if you have 60 seconds to spare!

If you have questions or comments for the show, you can hit us up [@vibratofm](http://twitter.com/vibratofm] on Twitter.
