<p><strong>Domain Driven Design &ndash; </strong>by Eric Evans</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321125215/sr=8-1/qid=1150164149/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-4563797-5996947?%5Fencoding=UTF8"><img alt="" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0321125215.01._BO2,204,203,200_PIlitb-dp-500-arrow,TopRight,32,-59_AA240_SH20_SCLZZZZZZZ_V66387483_.jpg" align="left" border="0" /></a></p><p>I just finished reading this book by Eric Evans on &ldquo;Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software.&rdquo;&nbsp; Domain Driven Design should really be required reading in college, in my opinion.&nbsp; Eric Evans has a way of describing benefits of rich modeling techniques and how to develop them.&nbsp; He guides you through&nbsp;learning to develop the&nbsp;<em>ubiquitous language</em> of the domain, an important concept for effective modeling.&nbsp; He also&nbsp;addresses many common concerns&nbsp;such as scalability with the techniques in the book.</p><p>This isn&rsquo;t your typical software book, chock full of simple examples to help make the author&rsquo;s point.&nbsp; Evans goes into enourmous detail on the examples and builds on them throughout the course of the book.&nbsp; The quality of the examples are what pushes the reader&rsquo;s understanding of the topic to a level that words cannot do alone.</p><p>Evans tends to be a bit wordy in this book, and you&rsquo;ll often find that he seems to be repeating himself, frequently with the same verbage.&nbsp; The message is important though, worth visiting more than once.&nbsp; </p><p>Domain Driven Design is among the most profound, impacting, and inspiring software books I have ever read.&nbsp; I give it a 5/5.</p>
