<p>I gave a presentation at the North Houston .NET User Group a couple weeks ago entitled "Rails Intrigue".  My friend, <a href="http://claudiolassala.wordpress.com/">Claudio Lassala</a> recorded it and posted the video on YouTube.</p>

<p>In the presentation, I tried to give a little glimpse of what it feels like to build an application with Rails.  I also tried to convey a little of why I think <strong>Rails is just Fun</strong>.</p>

<p>I think it went pretty well, for being mostly off the cuff.  Give it a watch, and let me know what you think.</p>
