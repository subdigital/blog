<p>I&rsquo;ve been struggling with some windows forms development in .NET 2.0 beta 2, and would really benefit from a good book, but there are none out!&nbsp; (Chris Sells&rsquo;s book is waiting on the final release, as are others&hellip;)</p><p>Anyone know of some good online resources or beta 2 books that I could pick up?</p>
