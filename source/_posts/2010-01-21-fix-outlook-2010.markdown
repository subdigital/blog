<p>Use GMail?&#160; Have you gotten an email from somebody that looks like this?</p>  <p><img src="/images/image_3___.png" alt="image"  height="220"  /> </p>  <p>They are likely using Outlook 2010.&#160; So what’s the issue?&#160; Well if you click the button to see the entire message, you see a fairly innocuous message.&#160; Nothing really out of the ordinary.&#160; But if you click on the drop down menu (next to the Reply button) and choose the option &quot;<strong>Show Original</strong>”&#160; You’ll see what the problem is:</p>  <p><img src="/images/image_6_.png" alt="image"  height="225"  /> </p>  <p>I was originally going to paste the HTML here for you to view, but it’s just too big.&#160; <strong>It crashed Windows Live Writer</strong>.</p>  <p>Let’s put it into perspective.&#160; If I were to send someone a letter with a simple request, it would likely take 1 page + envelope, etc.&#160; Now imagine their response was over 1 <em>thousand</em> pages.&#160; That’s how big the response is.&#160; It’s almost a megabyte when pasted into Notepad2:</p>  <p><img src="/images/image_9_.png" alt="image"  height="222"  /> </p>  <p>Why is Outlook generating such a disgusting excuse for an email reply?&#160; The answer lies in their decision to switch from the IE HTML rendering engine to the one found in Word.&#160; That’s right, that horrid-HTML producing pile of software, Microsoft Word.</p>  <p>Why the switch?&#160;&#160; According a <a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/post/2799/microsoft-to-ignore-web-standards-in-outlook-2010/" target="_blank">blog post from CampaignMonitor</a>:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>When asked why Outlook is using Word to compose HTML emails, this was his response:</p>    <blockquote>     <p>&quot;The reason for this lies in the benefit Outlook users gain by having Word as their e-mail authoring tool; rich tools like SmartArt, automatic styles and templates, and other benefits found in Word 2007 and 2010 enable Outlook users to write professional looking and visually stunning messages.&quot;</p>      <p>&quot;I am aware of where this decision on our part places Outlook from a standards perspective - at the same time, we ask that you consider the benefits Outlook users get from having Word tools in their e-mail authoring experience.&quot;</p>   </blockquote>    <p>When asked why Word is also used to render HTML emails, Dev explained:</p>    <blockquote>     <p>&quot;Having multiple HTML engines could reduce performance, as well as create an inconsistency in terms of what type of content the user is able to create vs. consume.&quot;</p>   </blockquote>    <p>Basically, Microsoft are using the Word rendering engine so emails <em>composed</em> in Outlook will look consistent when viewed by other Outlook users (also confirmed in <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/HA102109301033.aspx">this Microsoft white paper</a>).</p> </blockquote>  <p>I sincerely hope that Microsoft decides to either <strong>fix the Word HTML engine</strong> to actually render markup worthy of the web (and your email inbox) OR to <strong>abandon the goal to get Smart Art, automatic-styling, and templates for Outlook 2010</strong>.</p>  <p>What can you do?</p>  <p>Glad you asked!&#160; You can join the many thousands of others who are frustrated with this here:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.fixoutlook.org/">http://www.fixoutlook.org/</a></p>  <p>I probably won’t be using Outlook 2010, however so many of my colleagues and clients do, so I’ll be forced to cope with this.&#160; I actually think we have a better chance of Gmail filtering this crappy HTML before it hits your inbox than Microsoft to change its direction and likely delay Office 2010.&#160; However, I’d love to be proven wrong.</p>
