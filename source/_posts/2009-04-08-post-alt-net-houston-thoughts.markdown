<p><img src="/images/altnet-thisway.png" alt="altnet-thisway"  height="335" /></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Last weekend I helped organize the <a href="http://houston.altnetconf.com" target="_blank">Houston ALT.NET Open Space</a> conference.&nbsp; About 100 people came to share, learn, and grow as developers in the .NET (and surrounding) communities.</p> <p><img src="/images/thewall.png" alt="thewall"  height="337" /></p> <p>We had the pleasure of having <a href="http://www.stevenlist.com/blog/" target="_blank">Doc List</a> facilitate our gathering.&nbsp; It has been said before that Doc is the "adult supervision" to keep the developers in line.&nbsp; This is certainly true, as it is really easy for a bunch of geeks to get off topic and go play Rock Band all day.&nbsp; I really feel that he helped us be self-organized, rather than self-propelled chaos.&nbsp; Thanks, Doc!</p> <p><img src="/images/doc.png" alt="doc"  height="335" /> </p> <p>The topics were very technical, which I like.&nbsp; I enjoy process oriented talks, but I'm more drawn to the technical ones.&nbsp; There was a healthy dose of F# &amp; functional programming, Ruby (IronRuby, Rake), NHibernate (with FluentNHibernate &amp; NHibernate.Linq), Deployment automation, BDD, DDDD &amp; Command Query separation, and more.&nbsp; There were more talks proposed in this conference than any I have attended previously.&nbsp; I think that is one metric for success in a conference like this. </p> <p>I specifically noticed one session, labeled "Should I even be programming?"&nbsp; This guy had the courage to stand up in front of 100 people and admit that he wasn't sure if this was the career for him.&nbsp; I truly wish I had gone to this session, as I heard it was really good.&nbsp; I hope that he was given the type of advice he needed.&nbsp; One thing I was sure to mention is that we are all out there, on blogs, twitter, or simply around for lunch to continue the conversation.&nbsp; We don't have to be stuck in our job, isolated from the rest of the developer community.</p> <p><img src="/images/group1.png" alt="group1"  height="336" /> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The space that we had was graciously donated by Microsoft.&nbsp; It turned out to be a fantastic space for this type of event.&nbsp; Most rooms had projectors, it was all within one small area, so hallway conversations were very abundant.&nbsp; I have to send out a great thanks to <a href="http://blog.microsoft-j.net/" target="_blank">J Sawyer</a>, who gave me support to put this on.</p> <p><img src="/images/image_c5fd77a1-44a1-4c4a-a4ba-4192c732f7d1.png" alt="image"  height="338" /> </p> <p>Throughout the event, especially at the closing, many people thanked me directly, or thanked me "and the other organizers."&nbsp; Unfortunately, I neglected to mention their names!&nbsp; I did have help, folks!</p> <p>Here they are:</p> <p><img src="/images/organizers.png" alt="organizers"  height="337" /> </p> <p><em>From left to right:&nbsp; <a href="http://wizardsofsmart.net/" target="_blank">Jonathan Birkholz</a>, <a href="http://claudiolassala.spaces.live.com" target="_blank">Claudio Lassala</a>, <a href="http://stevenlist.com" target="_blank">Doc List</a>, <a href="http://www.jphamilton.net/" target="_blank">JP Hamilton</a>, <a href="http://pseale.com/blog" target="_blank">Peter Seale</a>, and myself</em>.&nbsp; I really appreciate all of your help!</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I mentioned that the number of topics was a good metric for success.&nbsp; The other major one, in my opinion, was the fact that the conference seemed to spark a certain fire for some of the attendees.&nbsp; Some of them asked for another conference next month!&nbsp; Others asked how they could join in with the monthly geek dinners.&nbsp; There's been some serious talk about organizing some Code Dojos in the area.&nbsp; All of these things make me feel proud to have been a part in this event.&nbsp; I hope that the passion spreads.</p> <p><a href="http://houstonaltnet.pbwiki.com" target="_blank">Our wiki</a> has some of the notes from the event.&nbsp; You can also check out the <a href="http://www.kyte.tv/ch/272888-altnethouston" target="_blank">videos</a>, and the photos, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/silviascheirman/sets/72157616293330415/" target="_blank">taken by my wife</a> (our beautiful official photographer) and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stevenlist/sets/72157616360308310/" target="_blank">by Doc</a> (who is less beautiful, but still takes good pictures).&nbsp; The videos are of webcam quality, and some higher quality ones will be posted at some point.&nbsp; I'll link to all of this on the <a href="http://houston.altnetconf.com" target="_blank">official conference website</a> whenever I get around to it.</p> <p>As for me, I'm taking a break from stuff for a while.&nbsp; I've been really quiet on this blog, mostly because of <a href="http://manning.com/palermo" target="_blank">my book</a>, but also life has become incredibly busy.&nbsp; I plan on spending some more time at night with the family, catching up on my never-ending reading list, and doing some programming for fun.&nbsp; Most of you know that <a href="http://flux88.com/blog/hello-world-x-2/" target="_blank">I have twins on the way</a>, and a little less than one month to prepare!</p> <h2>Thanks ALT.NET Houston!&nbsp; See you next year!</h2>
