<p>A few weeks back <a href="http://chadmyers.lostechies.com/" target="_blank">Chad Myers</a> and I recorded a screencast to demonstrate TDD in action.&nbsp; We had some issues with the recording (again) but I was able to mix it all up and produce this stellar TDD screencast for all of you friends.</p><p>A couple things to note:</p><ul><li>Chad and I are BDD enthusiasts, not experts... so you might see a bit of a quirky hybrid approach.&nbsp; Don't TwitterFlame us please ;).&nbsp; I am, however, finding that the more and more I use BDD style tests that I feel myself leaning towards that style, but it's a progression.</li><li>Chad and I apparently live in different time dimensions, as our audio streams were totally out of sync.&nbsp; I tried to fix it, but I'm a coder, not a production contortionist.&nbsp; It's definitely watchable, but the last 20 minutes or so is a bit off sync.</li><li>It's long...&nbsp; I tried to bring it down a bit by cutting out silence, but then I just wanted to release it already :)</li></ul><p>So without further ado, you can watch the screencast here:</p><p><a href="http://www.benscheirman.com/screencasts/tdd-inventory">http://www.benscheirman.com/screencasts/tdd-inventory</a></p><p>Total Length: 94min</p><p>Please let us know what you think in the comments.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you find this is useful then perhaps we will do more of these.</p><p><strong>update:&nbsp; a few of you have asked for the code.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be sure and make this available for future screencasts.&nbsp; You can download the project here: </strong></p><p><a href="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/TDDInventory.zip" target="_blank"><strong>File Attachment: TDDInventory.zip (139 KB)</strong></a></p>
