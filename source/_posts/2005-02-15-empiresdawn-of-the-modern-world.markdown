[Empires: Dawn of the Moder World](http://www.empiresrts.com/)

I am ADDICTED to this game! I played the original Empire Earth for a really long time, and this is a pretty good sequel.

One really cool thing is that Empire Earth 2 is coming out pretty soon, and it looks like another good addition to the series. The original EE 
will probably be offered free from Sierra once it hits stores, so keep an eye out for that. 

Playing these types of games makes me think of how good of an example they are for good object oriented design and opportunity 
for lots of design patterns.I really think a game like this is over my head at the moment, but it's nice to have something to 
strive for.

Most resell shops will have this game for about $10-$15, so pick it up... it's good.
