<p>I am <a href="http://agilehouston.org/Main/AdoptingAgile" target="_blank">going to be speaking on Adopting Agile</a> to our local Agile Houston user group.&nbsp; Our last presenter, Robert Martin was excellent, and the speaker following me (who I shall not yet name for fear of jinxing it) is going to be stellar as well.&nbsp; <em>Maybe if I sandwich myself between great people I can be great by proxy.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll see.</em></p><p>Anyway we&rsquo;re not yet sure of the venue (might not be at UH this time), so keep an eye out on the <a href="http://agilehouston.org/" target="_blank">agile houston website</a> for details.&nbsp; The date will either be September 24<sup>th</sup> or 25<sup>th</sup>, but I thought I would announce it now to give ample notice to those of you who are in Houston but don&rsquo;t subscribe to the <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/render?cid=agilehouston.org_8usi44um97qqppr46b8g3383s4%40group.calendar.google.com" target="_blank">Agile Houston calendar</a>.</p><p>My talk will cover some of the foundational principles that are deemed &ldquo;agile&rdquo; and why they are valuable.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll also talk about the best way to go about introducing agile at a solo level, a team level, and a company level.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like it to go off as a sort of dialog to get everyone sharing experiences and opinions.</p><p>Come check it out next week!</p>
