<p>I&rsquo;ve had a bad case&nbsp;of Mac/Ruby envy lately.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll post more on the Mac thoughts later, this post is about <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a>.</p><p>If you don&rsquo;t know what RoR is, then maybe you should go to the website and take a look.</p><p><img src="/images/tadalist1_small.jpg" hspace="5"  border="0"  /></p><p>I keep seeing these Ruby applications that are so simple, elegant, and <strong>useful</strong>.&nbsp; Take <a href="http://www.tadalist.com/" target="_blank">tadalist</a>&nbsp;for example.&nbsp; This is a painfully simple application but it works the way I want it to and it&rsquo;s&nbsp;always available.</p><p>I use tadalist more than I&nbsp;use Outlook&rsquo;s todo list interface.</p><p>It&rsquo;s just so much cleaner, it&rsquo;s always available, and it doesn&rsquo;t get in your way.</p><p>Maybe this is due to the &ldquo;ruby way&rdquo; of thinking.&nbsp; I have seen countless applications written in JSP or ASP.NET that just look like someone vomited html all over the page.&nbsp; Where are all of the interaction designers in the .NET space?</p><p>Another&nbsp;Ruby application that I have seen that I think is incredibly useful and elegant is <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/" target="_blank">Basecamp</a>.&nbsp; This is a project management utility that is basically the Anti-Microsoft Project.&nbsp; They took all of the things that they didn&rsquo;t like about Project and built Basecamp, stripping down tons of features to boil down into the a simple, useful project collaboration application.&nbsp; Check out the screenshot to see what I mean.&nbsp; The interface is slick, and it has everything you need to know, right there.</p><p><a href="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/basecamp1.jpg"><img src="/images/basecamp1_thumb.jpg" hspace="5"  border="0"  /></a>I used this to collaborate on a small project and found it to be incredibly intuitive.</p><p>It isn&rsquo;t intuitive because it was written in Rails.&nbsp; It is intuitive because the <a title="37 signals" href="http://37signals.com/" target="_blank">people behind it</a> are brilliant.&nbsp; And these particular brilliant people swear by&nbsp;Rails.</p><p>Every time I try to use Project to get a hold of the overall picture of my current project I get lost, and I don&rsquo;t see much value in that beast of an application.</p><p><a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/" target="_blank">Thoughtworks</a> is jumping in as well into the ruby space.&nbsp; In&nbsp;a <a title="hanselminutes" href="http://hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=82" target="_blank">recent interview</a> with <a href="http://martinfowler.com/" target="_blank">Martin Fowler</a>, he claimed that somewhere around 60% of their consulting work is in Ruby now.&nbsp; 60%!&nbsp; I find that very hard to ignore.&nbsp; Check out their newest online application for managing agile projects:&nbsp; it&rsquo;s called <a href="http://studios.thoughtworks.com/mingle-project-intelligence" target="_blank">Mingle</a>, and it looks awesome.</p><p><a href="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/mingle.JPG"><img src="/images/mingle_thumb.jpg" hspace="5"  border="0"  /></a></p><p>I&rsquo;ve found 2 more ruby examples that I am really keen on:&nbsp; <a href="http://warehouseapp.com/" target="_blank">Warehouse</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://lighthouseapp.com/" target="_blank">Lighthouse</a>.</p><div><a href="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/warehouse1.JPG"><img src="/images/warehouse1_thumb.jpg" hspace="5"  border="0"  /></a><a href="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/warehouse2.JPG"><img src="/images/warehouse2_thumb1.jpg" hspace="5"  border="0"  /></a></div><div><p>Warehouse is a subversion repository browser with a slick interface.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s only 30 bucks, too!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lighthouse looks even cooler.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a bug tracking application that integrates with subversion and email.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d really like to take this application for a spin.</p></div><div><a href="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/lighthouse.JPG"><img src="/images/lighthouse_thumb.jpg" hspace="5"  border="0"  /></a></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>These applications do share a common interface style, but that doesn&rsquo;t exactly mean it&rsquo;s a bad thing.&nbsp; The design of these applications is simple, polished, and actually pleasing to look at.&nbsp; Try to think about those things with Team Foundation Server and see if you get the same feeling.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>This raises the question, Why are Ruby Applications so Elegant?&nbsp; Well, not all are&hellip; but the majority are.&nbsp;&nbsp; </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>I&rsquo;d say, some major factors are:</div><ul><li>The typical ruby developer is also a Mac user.</li><ul><li>the typical Mac user appreciates design.</li></ul><li>The mantra&nbsp;of &ldquo;less is more&rdquo; radiates from the language (Ruby), the web framework (Rails), and the interface.</li></ul><p>I&rsquo;m really jealous of the&nbsp;work that some of these folks are doing.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is&nbsp;contributing to my Mac Envy, which I will post on later.</p><p>Am I just becoming a fan-boy?&nbsp; What do you think?&nbsp;</p><a href="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/warehouse2.JPG"></a><div class="bjtags">Tags:<a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/Ruby">Ruby</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/Rails">Rails</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/Design">Design</a></div>
