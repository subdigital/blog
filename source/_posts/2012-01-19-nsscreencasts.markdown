## Bite-Sized Learning

Video training is becoming a very common way to learn these days.  With [Tekpub](http://tekpub.com), [Peepcode](http://peepcode.com/), [Pluralsight](http://pluralsight.com), 
[Code School](http://codeschool.com), and many others, there are usually great productions to teach you any development topic that you'd want to learn about.

All of these services are great, however I'm becoming a fan of the smaller, more focused screencasts.  [Railscasts](http://railscasts.com), for instance, has
been _instrumental_ to my Rails learning development.  [Destroy all Software](http://destroyallsoftware.com/) teaches me new things every week.

Smaller videos like this are easier to digest, and are more focused on a single topic.  Like the [boiled frog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog)
you eventually realize how far you've come on a topic, simply by watching regular videos.

iOS Development is an ever-changing landscape, with so many topic areas to cover, that a single training class or screencast series just
can't teach you all of it.  Instead of trying to cover everything in depth (increasing the length of videos). I find it valuable to 
have smaller, focused tutorials that teach you one thing, and do it quickly and effectively.

## Introducing NSScreencast

[NSScreencast](http://nsscreencast.com) will be launching soon and will feature regular bite-sized videos
focused on a single topic related to Objective-C and building iOS applications.

NSScreencast _will_ include free videos. Down the road, a nominal paid subsribtion will unlock access to more content.

I still have lots to do before I release the first video, but if you like the idea, please sign up on 
the site to be notified when it launches. Thanks!
