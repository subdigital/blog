<p>I&rsquo;ve been running Vista for about&nbsp;6 months now, and I really like it.&nbsp; There are a lot of issues that I have run into, but some of the minor ones are easy to fix.</p><p>For example, I downloaded <a href="http://e-texteditor.com/" target="_blank">e-texteditor</a>&nbsp;which is like TextMate for Windows.&nbsp; It uses Cygwin for some advanced features, so when you try to use then (like Alt-Shift-Comma for auto-wrapping html brackets and closing tags on a word) &mdash; E goes to install <a href="http://cygwin.com/" target="_blank">Cygwin</a>.&nbsp; Under Vista, clicking on &ldquo;Install&rdquo; does nothing.</p><p><a href="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/e.JPG"><img src="/images/e_thumb_.jpg" alt="E - a TextMate clone for Windows"  border="0"  /></a></p><p>The solution is to Run as Administrator.&nbsp; A lot of programs out there aren&rsquo;t testing on Vista so they don&rsquo;t realize that many of the features require elevated access, and if they silently suppress the issue, the user never knows what&rsquo;s going wrong.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the fault of the application, not Vista.</p><p>SQL Management Studio Express does this to me as well.&nbsp; I always have to run that program as Administrator.</p><div class="bjtags">Tags:<a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/Vista">Vista</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/UAC">UAC</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/Cygwin">Cygwin</a>, <a rel="tag" href="http://technorati.com/tag/E-TextEditor">E-TextEditor</a></div>
