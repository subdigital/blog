<p>I attended TulsaTechFest 2006 this past weekend and I had a fantastic time.&nbsp; I was able to meet a number of interesting people and learned quite a bit.</p><p>I attended&hellip;</p><ul><li><strong><em>NUnit Extensibility with <a title="Tim Rayburn's blog" href="http://www.timrayburn.net/" target="_blank">Tim Rayburn</a><br /></em></strong>Tim is an incredibly passionate guy.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t have quite enough time to fully cover his presentation, though I did learn from it.&nbsp; He ended up spending about 15 minutes of it just pimping CodeRush. <img src="/images/smile1__________________________.gif"   /><br /></li><li><strong><em>IoC / DI with <a title="Dru Sellers' blog" href="http://geekswithblogs.net/dsellers/" target="_blank">Dru Sellers</a><br /></em></strong>Inversion of Control / Dependency Injection has been an interest of mine for some time now, but it&rsquo;s a tad difficult to wrap your head around how it actually works.&nbsp; In theory I understood it, but with Dru&rsquo;s explanation I am now fully onboard with it and will definitely start utilizing it in my projects at home to get better at it.&nbsp; Dru was very excited about it and it showed.&nbsp; His talk was very casual and informative.<br /></li><li><strong><em>POCOS In Action with <a title="Dru Seller's blog" href="http://geekswithblogs.net/dsellers/" target="_blank">Dru Sellers</a><br /></em></strong>POCOs, or Plain Old CLR Objects, is a concept adopted from Java (you guessed it: POJOs) which is basically a move away from Entity Java Beans.&nbsp; The gist of it is that we&rsquo;d like to focus on simple objects that express our domain model and business rules <strong>and nothing else.</strong>&nbsp; No infrastructure mixed in with our logic.&nbsp; No persistence related concerns embedded in our objects.&nbsp; This talk was very high level and actually blended with IoC and NHibernate, so I wish I would have attended another talk.&nbsp; Dru did a great job explaining the POCO mentality and I know he made a great impact on my buddy Tom, a Java developer.<br /></li><li><em><strong>NHibernate with <a title="Dru Sellers' blog" href="http://geekswithblogs.net/dsellers/" target="_blank">Dru Sellers</a> </strong>(see a pattern?)<br /></em>I attended this talk mainly to show the flag, as I knew it would be more of an introductory overview.&nbsp; The audience seemed genuinely interested in the subject and Dru explained it well.&nbsp; I also contributed my&nbsp;two cents&nbsp;and I hope I wasn&rsquo;t intruding <img src="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/smile1.gif" />.<br /></li><li><strong><em>The Science of Great UI with Mark Miller<br /></em></strong>UI Design is a big interest of mine, but the fact that Mark Miller was presenting sealed the deal on this talk.&nbsp; Mark is crazy, and if you haven&rsquo;t listened to him on <a title="Mondays (podcast)" href="http://mondays.pwop.com/" target="_blank">Mondays</a> or <a title="Millahseconds (podcast)" href="http://millahseconds.com/" target="_blank">Millahseconds</a>, you really should.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s insanely hilarious and I thoroughly enjoyed his presentation.&nbsp; My favorite part of this presentation was when Mark shoved his kid off of his lap to take a picture of a &ldquo;horribly conceived modal dialog box ever&rdquo; in a Lego game he was playing with his kids.&nbsp; I can totally see him doing that.<br /></li><li><strong><em>Component-based Architectures with Mark Miller<br /></em></strong>This talk was about to get <em>very</em> interesting when Mark ran out of time.&nbsp; Some of us were a bit confused on where he was going, and we talked to him about it afterwards and he was eager to hear the feedback.&nbsp; Basically he argued that in order to gain the best competitive advantage, we as developers should focus on implementing new features faster, (features and time being two out of 4&ndash;5 aspects of a product that we control) and to do that we have to understand how difficult it is for new developers to just get work done.&nbsp; He argued that the less visible structure that your code has, the easier it is to add new features.&nbsp; Mark is a fan of building components (yes, like the ones you drag onto a component surface in visual studio).&nbsp; If you aren&rsquo;t clicking with this yet, and I fully understand why, then you should go try to create a plug-in with Visual Studio and see if you can get a simple one completed.&nbsp; Then go try it with the free&nbsp;<a title="DXCore (free VS Plugin tool)" href="http://devexpress.com/Products/NET/IDETools/DXCore/" target="_blank">DXCore</a> and see if you aren&rsquo;t blown away at its simplicity.</li></ul><p>I also won a book, <a title="Amazon link" href="http://www.amazon.com/Professional-Ajax-Programmer-Nicholas-Zakas/dp/0471777781/sr=8-1/qid=1161229311/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-6616954-0199241?ie=UTF8" target="_blank">Professional Ajax</a> (WROX) which is now 8th on my reading list.</p><p>After the event I met up with <a title="Tim Gifford's blog" href="http://blogs.giffordconsulting.com/" target="_blank">Tim Gifford</a> and <a title="Javier Lozano's blog" href="http://lozanotek.com/" target="_blank">Javier Lozano</a>, and we went to an Irish pub and later mosied on down to Arnie&rsquo;s to where Microsoft was buying drinks!&nbsp; I met up with Shaun Walker (from DNN fame)&nbsp;there and I made sure to give him a hard time about his picture. <img src="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/smile1.gif" />&nbsp; Sorry Shaun, no hard feelings!&nbsp; (He&rsquo;s really a cool guy).&nbsp; At the bar we enjoyed some tech conversation and jager bombs (ouch) and had a good time.</p><p>I can&rsquo;t wait to go again next year.</p>
