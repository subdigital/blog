[Houston Code Camp 2012](http://houstoncodecamp.com) is happening on August 25th
at the Microsoft offices in Houston, TX.

This is going to be a great event!  Last year we had sessions on Ruby, C#, JavaScript, iOS, and lots more.  It's definitely a polyglot event
where there is something for everyone.  

We're looking for speakers, so if you're interested in speaking, please 
[submit a topic](http://houstoncodecamp.com/session_suggestions/new). I hope you'll consider being a part of it.


Registration is not yet open, but keep a look out on [twitter](http://twitter.com/houstoncodecamp) or this blog for more details.
