<p><img src="/images/palermo_cover150_.jpg" hspace="20"  border="0"  />The cat is out of the bag now!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m writing a book on ASP.NET MVC for Manning Press entitled ASP.NET MVC in Action.&nbsp; I really thrilled to be part of this along with my co-authors <a href="http://jeffreypalermo.com/" target="_blank">Jeffrey Palermo</a> and <a href="http://daveverwer.com/" target="_blank">Dave Verwer</a>.</p><p>So far 3 chapters are available on <a href="http://manning.com/palermo/" target="_blank">Manning&rsquo;s Early Access Program</a>.&nbsp; We&rsquo;d love to hear your feedback on the book so far.</p><p>Writing a book is much harder than I originally thought, but I think that blogging for four years has definitely helped.&nbsp; With a book, everything has to be much more &ldquo;polished,&rdquo; so finishing up chapters tends to take a while.&nbsp; This might explain my drop in posting frequency, but I hope to add tidbits of information that I&rsquo;m working on to give you guys a peek at what the book will be like.</p><p>Our target release date will be October 2008.</p>
