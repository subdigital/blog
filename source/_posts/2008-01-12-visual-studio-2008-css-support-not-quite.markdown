<p>One of the often-touted new features of VS 2008 is the improved CSS support.</p><p>I like having intellisense for CSS, sure, but I dont&rsquo; want to have a warning for classes that don&rsquo;t exist&hellip;. like this:</p><p><img src="/images/vs2008_2Dcss_2Dwarning_small.jpg" hspace="5"  border="0"  /></p><p>That green squiggly indicates a compiler warning.&nbsp; It can&rsquo;t find the CSS class, (which <em>is</em> referenced in the Master Page).&nbsp; </p><p>But there are other reasons why you might want to define a class without defining an associated style.&nbsp; You might be using it to distinctly select elements from the DOM using javascript.&nbsp; </p><p>The ever-so-awesome <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/" target="_blank">prototype</a> framework introduced this syntax:</p><p>$$(&lsquo;.info&rsquo;)</p><p>which would select all of the elements with a class name of &ldquo;info&rdquo; for you to work with.</p><p>Just about every other javascript library out there now supports this syntax (or a similar one).</p><p>If this bugs you, you can turn it off by checking this box (in Tools -&gt; Options) :</p><p><img src="/images/vs2008_2Dturn_2Doff_2Dhtml_2Derrors.png" hspace="5"  border="0"  /></p><p>You may not want to do this, though&hellip;&nbsp; it could potentially save you time if you&rsquo;re looking for a rendering bug.</p><p>Another part of VS 2008 that I don&rsquo;t really care about is this CSS designer.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t imagine anyone who would actually use this.</p><p>I mean, come on&hellip; look at it!</p><p><img src="/images/vs2008_2Dcss_2Dbuilder_small.jpg" hspace="5"  border="0"  /></p><p>I guess if you don&rsquo;t know CSS very well, you might want some options.&nbsp; But that form is more confusing to me than <strong>border-top: solid 1px #999;</strong>.</p><p>(and one could argue, if you don&rsquo;t know CSS, should you be defining styles at all?)</p><p>I really applaud Microsoft&rsquo;s attempt to bring a better CSS development experience to the masses, but I think they missed the mark on this one.</p>
