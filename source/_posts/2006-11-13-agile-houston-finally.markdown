<p>I was very excited to hear the creation of the first Houston Agility User Group, <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/agilehouston">Agile Houston</a>.</p><p>If you are interested in Agile practices and methodologies and live in the Houston area, I encourage you to join the group and attend the first meeting!</p><p>Currently I expect the first meeting to occur sometime in January, so as soon as I find out a definite date, I&rsquo;ll post it here.</p>
