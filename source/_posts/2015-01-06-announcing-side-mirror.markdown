I’m proud to announce [Side Mirror](http://sidemirrorapp.com), an app for presenters who do live demos.

<a href="http://sidemirrorapp.com">

</a>

Side Mirror shows you a preview of what’s on your connected displays (like a projector).

Why is this useful?

- You can keep your notes on your main screen
- Refer to code snippets / copy & paste to demo
- You can click through the preview window to the same position on the monitor, to avoid awkward mousing
- You can stop craning your neck when doing live demos!

[Side Mirror](http://sidemirrorapp.com/) is available on the Mac App Store for just $9.99.
