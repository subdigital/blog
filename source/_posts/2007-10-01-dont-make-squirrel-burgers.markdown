<p>Your manager comes to you and says &ldquo;Hey, Joe.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s talk.&nbsp; I&nbsp;need to get a new system developed to keep track of our help desk calls.&nbsp; It needs to have a slick user-interface that is easy to navigate, it needs to be fast, and also we need integration with SAP.&rdquo;&nbsp; You ponder what the system architecture might be like.&nbsp; He continues.&nbsp; &ldquo;So how long do you think this will take?&rdquo;</p><p>Of course, your first instinct is to <strong>tell your manager that you&rsquo;ll get back to him later with a rough estimate</strong>, but he is in a hurry and persistent.&nbsp; You cave in and tell him, &ldquo;I think it would take&nbsp;6 weeks.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hrm, 6 weeks?&nbsp; I really need it in 5 weeks, no later.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Your manager is already negotiating your rough estimate.&nbsp; Be afraid.&nbsp; </em>You start to figure out how you can accomplish all of this in 5 weeks and you are realizing that you really needed <strong><em>eight</em></strong> weeks, not six.&nbsp; Let me put this story on pause while I tell you another story&hellip;</p><blockquote><p>Bob is the new night manager at FatBurger.&nbsp; One night a man walks in and requests a double Fat-burger with cheese, a large order of Fat Fries, and a chocolate shake.&nbsp; He pulls out the change in his pocket and Bob finds out that he only has $1.20.&nbsp; The entire meal costs $7.50.</p><p>What would you do in this situation?&nbsp; Turn away your only customer in the 11:00pm hour?&nbsp; Offer something that he <em>can</em> afford?&nbsp; Give it to him for $1.20&nbsp;<em>this time only?</em></p><p>Bob, being a proud night manager, wants to satisfy his customer.&nbsp; He cannot give away the food cheaply because then the guy will return again, expecting another discount.&nbsp; So Bob decides to get creative.&nbsp; He goes around back and finds a dead squirrel on the pavement.&nbsp; He scrapes it up with&nbsp;a shovel and brings it inside, grills it up and gives it to the man.</p></blockquote><p>In this story, Bob sacrified quality to give the gentleman what he wanted for only $1.20.</p><p>Stop me if this scenario sounds familiar.</p><p>Back at your desk, you are realizing that you are about to deliver to your manager a squirrel-burger.&nbsp; He wants X features, but you can&rsquo;t deliver them on time.&nbsp; The first thing you are going to throw out are automated tests.&nbsp; Then you&rsquo;ll stop refactoring.&nbsp; Pretty soon you are just heads-down coding like you did in high school and you are making a huge mess.</p><p>Two things are likely to happen.&nbsp; The system will buckle under its own weight because the code reaks of dead squirrels.&nbsp; The other thing that is likely to happen is that your system becomes useful, and now management has another request.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey Joe.&nbsp; The new system rocks!&nbsp; I just got off the phone with marketing and they want to start selling this to our larger clients.&rdquo;</p><p>Now you&rsquo;re in a pickle.&nbsp; You have a spaghetti-mess of a system and now you need to extend it and polish it for redistribution.&nbsp; </p><p>This sad state of affairs is all too common.&nbsp; Your manager might want a double Fat burger with cheese in 5&ndash;weeks, but what he&rsquo;s getting is a squirrel burger.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t deliver squirrel burgers.&nbsp; Be careful with off-the-cuff estimates that end up turning into negotiations.&nbsp; Joe should have negotiated features instead of quality to meet his 5&ndash;week deadline.&nbsp; Estimates should include time for automated tests and refactoring because it is part of your daily coding activity and it helps maintain quality.</p><p><em>I first heard the&nbsp;term &ldquo;squirrel burgers&rdquo; and the above story from Mark Pushinsky</em>.</p>
