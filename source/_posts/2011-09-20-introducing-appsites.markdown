I've not been that great about marketing Giggle Touch.  It's a cool app,
kids like it, but most people don't know about it.

The biggest reason was probably that I never set up a proper website for
it.  Doing a search would only yield a blog post that said it was
"coming soon."

That's all changed now.  I'd like to introduce *App Sites*.

## [App Sites](http://appsites.heroku.com)

The premise is simple: _standup a website for an iPhone
app in minutes_.

Check it out here:
[http://appsites.heroku.com](http://appsites.heroku.com).

You can see the site in action by visiting the
[Giggle Touch](http://appsites.heroku.com/giggletouch) page.

It's free (for now) and gives you the ability to add features, a
description, a link back to the app, and a screenshot.

Planned upcoming features include:

- Custom domains
- Multiple screenshots
- Videos
- Coming soon (if the app hasn't launched yet)
- More analytics

If you have an iPhone app, I encourage you to create a page.  Let me
know what you think!
