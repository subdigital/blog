<p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">We&#8217;re getting very close to the 2nd ALT.NET Open Spaces Conference in Houston. This year we&#8217;re doing it a tad differently, and we&#8217;re holding 2 half-day workshops on Friday, April 30th.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 5.0px 0.0px 5.0px 0.0px; font: 18.0px 'Times New Roman'"><b>Deep Dive into Windows Azure</b></p>
<p style="margin: 5.0px 0.0px 5.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px 'Times New Roman'"><i>Scott Densmore</i><img src="/images/scottden_.jpg"  style="float:right; margin-bottom:10px; margin-left:10px;"  /><br /></p>
<p style="margin: 5.0px 0.0px 5.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px 'Times New Roman'">Scott (who recently re-joined Microsoft) will go from soup-to-nuts and show you how to build applications on Windows Azure. He has a ton of material and it will be a very hands-on workshop. If you have any plans (or even qualms) about building applications in the cloud, you should attend this workshop.</p>

<p style="margin: 5.0px 0.0px 5.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px 'Times New Roman'">In this workshop, JB will take you from a basic book understanding of WPF and discuss what works, what doesn&#8217;t work and why. With extensive experience in WPF, JB will guide you into better practices in order to create complex yet maintainable WPF applications.</p><font face="'Times New Roman'"><br /></font> <font face="'Times New Roman'">Best of all is these workshops are free (included with your registration to the conference)! That's a measly $20 for an entire weekend of brain-busting software development advice &amp; collaboration with experts from the Houston &amp; surrounding areas. Trust me, it's well worth it!</font><font face="'Times New Roman'"><br /></font><font face="'Times New Roman'"><span style="font-family: Helvetica;"><font face="'Times New Roman'">The workshops will run from Noon on Friday, April 30th until 5pm. At 6pm, we'll start gathering to do our planning, and our wonderful facilitator, Doc List, will set the stage for the rest of the weekend.</font> <font face="'Times New Roman'"><br /></font></span></font><font face="'Times New Roman'">You can register here: http://altnethouston.com</font><font face="'Times New Roman'"><br /></font><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">Be sure to tell your colleagues as well, as we'd like to see some fresh faces this year.</span><font face="'Times New Roman'"><br /></font><font face="'Times New Roman'">Don't miss out on this great event!</font>
