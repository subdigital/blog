<h3>#1 – Read Upwards</h3><p>I like to read my feeds grouped by feed, oldest first.&#160; Scroll down to the last post in the list and press “K” to read upwards from there.&#160; “J” does the opposite &amp; reads downwards.&#160; This is especially useful for busy feeds like <a href="http://slashdot.org" target="_blank">Slashdot</a> or <a href="http://lifehacker.com" target="_blank">Lifehacker</a>, where there are easily 50 posts to read in a day.</p><h3>#2 – Next/Previous Feed</h3><p>When using the method above, it’s useful to use Shift+N or Shift+P to navigate to next previous subscription.&#160; This keeps your fingers on the keyboard instead of reaching for the mouse.</p><h3>#3 – More Screen Real-Estate</h3><p>If you need more space for reading, press “U” to hide the left column.&#160; Pressing “U” will get it back again.</p><h3>#4 – Open In-line</h3><p>If you want to comment on a post (or just click through to see what the site looks like), you can open the post’s original site within the google reader pane.&#160; Just CTRL-Click the title of the post.</p><h3>#5 – Ninja Mode</h3><p>Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A.</p><p><em>No, I’m not kidding on this one.</em></p><h3>#6 – On-screen help</h3><p>Press Shift+? to see a nice layout of all the keyboard shortcuts available to you.</p><p>&#160;</p><p>What’s your favorite Google Reader tip?</p>
