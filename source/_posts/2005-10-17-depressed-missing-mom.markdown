<p>I&rsquo;ve been down in the dumps about my mom recently.&nbsp; I know it&rsquo;s to be expected, but it&rsquo;s strange how it hits me now, even more than at her funeral.</p><p>I think part of it is because I was <strong>very </strong>close to the situation, almost jaded by it, and now that things have had a chance to settle it&rsquo;s more <strong>real</strong>.&nbsp; We rarely even walk into her room anymore, so 1/3 of our house is completely unused.&nbsp; This will change sometime soon, but I&rsquo;m not sure when.</p><p>This week I hope to bring her ashes home (my aunt has been hogging them <img src="http://ben.lyntonweb.com/blog/uploads/smile1.gif" />).&nbsp; I hope that may help me feel a little better.</p>
