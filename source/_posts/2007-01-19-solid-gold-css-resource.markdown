I came across this site today, which boats <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/01/19/53-css-techniques-you-couldnt-live-without/"><b>53 CSS Techniques you can't live without</b></a>.<br><br>Normally I don't like to blog just links, but this one is definitely worth it.&nbsp; It covers most of the major techniques, both simple and advanced for styling web pages.<br><p></p>
