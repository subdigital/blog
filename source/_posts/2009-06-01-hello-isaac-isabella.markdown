<p><strong>Isabella Rose Scheirman (4 lbs 10 oz, born at 7:34 PM on 5/23/2009)</strong></p>
<p>The babies were 6 weeks premature, so they're still in the hospital. They're both healthy, good lung development, they can maintain their temperature, etc. They just need to gain some more weight so they can come home!</p>
<p>Needless to say, I've been incredibly busy... :)<br /></p>
<p>I've uploaded more photos are <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bensilvia/sets/72157618845380244/">up on flickr</a> if you're interested.</p>
