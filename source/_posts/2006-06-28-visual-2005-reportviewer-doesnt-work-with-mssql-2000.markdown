<p>I was trying to connect a 2005 WinForms ReportViewer&nbsp;control to a SSRS 2000 report server and I kept getting an HTTP 404, even though the url was correct.</p><p>Apparently it&rsquo;s not supported.</p><p>The error message did say &ldquo;Make sure this report server is compatible with the ReportViewer&rdquo; but I think that&rsquo;s something that they should just come out and tell me.&nbsp; I mean, come on&hellip; ReportViewer 2005 can easily recognize that I&rsquo;m connecting to a 2000 report server.</p><p>I had to spend 20 minutes searching the internet to get a definitive answer.&nbsp; Hopefully this will save someone some grief.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
