<p>I&rsquo;m kind of a nut when it comes to nit-pickiness in applications.&nbsp; I have always wanted to use Office Tasks as my todo list, however it was never effective enought to stick with.</p><p>The <a href="http://lifehacker.com/" target="_blank">lifehacker</a> recommended todo.txt&nbsp;is as lo-fi you can get before going completely non-tech, but I really don&rsquo;t want to manage a text file.&nbsp; I want the computer to work for me.</p><p>I recently discovered todoist.com, a minimalist, but oh-so-flexible todo-list application that really has me using it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s got more umph than the excellent tadalist.com, and this is why it&rsquo;s more useful to me.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s a screenshot of my current list.&nbsp; I have top-level projects called <strong>Work, Home, and Leisure</strong> and I drill down from there.</p><p><img src="/images/todoist_small.jpg" alt="Todoist"  border="0"  /></p><p>Notice how I have recurring tasks in the @Home project.&nbsp; (Also, notice that I didn&rsquo;t mow the lawn or sweep the driveway this weekend.&nbsp; Oops!&nbsp; I guess this goes to show you that no matter how fancy your todo list is implemented, you still actually have to DO stuff to accomplish anything)</p><p>I also jot down little notes and things, such as what movies to rent or buy next, or what my reading list looks like.</p><p>Todoist has a pretty simple API as well.&nbsp; Everything is token based, so you have a long token that serves as your credentials for making a call.&nbsp; This is similar to the way that google does it.</p><p>Speaking of google, todoist integrates with GMail with a simple bookmarklet or firefox plugin.&nbsp; Just open an email within GMail and click the bookmarklet and the email shows up as a task in todoist.</p><p>Another awesome feature is the <a href="http://launchy.net/" target="_blank">Launchy</a> plugin.&nbsp; Everyone knows I loves me some Launchy, but now I can type <strong>todo | add &ldquo;get some milk&rdquo; to &ldquo;Shopping&rdquo;</strong> and todoist will pick it up.&nbsp; Slick.</p><p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m smitten with this tool.&nbsp; What do you use to manage your todolist?&nbsp; If it&rsquo;s not Outlook, then I&rsquo;d like to hear about it in the comments.&nbsp; (If it is Outlook, I suppose you can comment as well, I&rsquo;ll forgive you)</p>
