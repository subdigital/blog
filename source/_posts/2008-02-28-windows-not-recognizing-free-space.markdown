<p>I&rsquo;ve been having problems lately with my primary hard drive filling up.&nbsp; Every once in a while Windows will tell me that I am running out of space on drive C: with only 500mb!&nbsp; After I cough up my tongue I run <a href="http://ccleaner.com/" target="_blank">CCleaner</a> and do a quick <a href="http://windirstat.info/" target="_blank">WinDirStat</a> report to see my big offenders.&nbsp; Nothing glaring ever shows up in the report and I end up just deleting a bunch of old programs and other piddly files that probably only total to 1gb.&nbsp; But Windows shuts up and I move on.</p><p>The last time this happened I took my World of Warcraft directory and manually (and painfully) moved it over to another drive.&nbsp; This should have freed up 8gb.&nbsp; It didn&rsquo;t.</p><p>Today I started digging.&nbsp; Windows correctly sees my drive size as 69.2GB, and reports that I only have 3.15GB free.&nbsp; That must mean that ~65GB are in use.&nbsp; However, <a href="http://www.jgoodies.com/freeware/jdiskreport/" target="_blank">JDiskReport</a> (and WinDirStat) is showing that only 24gb are in use.</p><p><img src="/images/explorer_2Ddrive_2Dspace_small_.jpg" alt="Explorer-drive-space"  border="0"  /></p><p><img src="/images/jdisk_2Dreport_small_.jpg" alt="Jdisk-report"  border="0"  /></p><p>I ran <strong>chkdsk</strong> to get a raw view of the drive&nbsp;(and to see if there are any errors) and everything came out clean.&nbsp; It reports that I have 15gb free!</p><p><img src="/images/chkdsk_2Ddrive_2Dspace_small_.jpg" alt="Chkdsk-drive-space"  border="0"  /></p><p>Defrag is scheduled to run weekly and windows tells me that it doesn&rsquo;t need a defrag.&nbsp; At this point I&rsquo;m wondering whether the drive is faulty or do I just need to reformat this drive&hellip; (I&rsquo;d rather not do this, of course)</p><p>Any ideas?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m out of rope at this point.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
