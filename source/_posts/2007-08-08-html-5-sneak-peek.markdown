<p>Check out&nbsp;the article over at IBM on <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/x-html5/?ca=dgr-lnxw01NewHTML" target="_blank">New Elements in HTML 5</a>.</p><p>Everyone who knows me knows that I loathe using tables for layout.&nbsp; My biggest beef with it (there are many) are that it usually renders an unnecessary amount of markup for simple things.&nbsp;&nbsp;Good CSS design reduces this drastically but there are occasions when you have a layout that ends up being as bloated as using tables.</p><p>If you need to style two sections of divs that have a similar or convoluted hierarchy, you usually have to resort to adding classes.&nbsp; Classes add to the visual weight of the HTML, so I generally prefer not to use them if I can select the element using CSS.</p><p>New tags in HTML 5 will help with this even further.&nbsp; These are all semantic structural tags that encourage proper design using HTML:</p><ul><li>section</li><li>header</li><li>footer</li><li>nav</li><li>article</li></ul><p>A &lt;`section&gt; `element will denote regions of the page that can easily be selected. Who knows, &lt;`section&gt; `might even replace &lt;`div&gt;`.</p><p>You&rsquo;ll also notice a trend where tags have no visual representation at all.&nbsp; They might be styled differently by CSS, but that&rsquo;s not the point.&nbsp; a &lt;time&gt; element could be used for programs to easily distinguish the time of a post, or the time that the page was last rendered, for example.</p><p>Check out the article, it is worth a read.&nbsp; These changes are long overdue and will help raise the bar on web standards usage even further.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s just hope IE plays nice this time (I think they will).</p>
