### What‚Äôs Side Mirror, you ask?

If you aren‚Äôt familiar, Side Mirror is a tool for presenters, educators, and anyone who does live demos. It works by showing you what's shown on a connected display in scenarios where you can‚Äôt see it.

For instance:

- A projector that‚Äôs behind you
- A monitor that is turned away from you so others can see

You might use Display Mirroring for this, but then you can‚Äôt have hidden things like notes, code snippets, ready-made files, or whatever else you might use for the demo. With Side Mirror, you can have all of that stuff accessible on your main screen (which only _you_ can see) and the content that‚Äôs on the other display shows up in a window that you can see on your screen.

In essence, Side Mirror can help you stop doing this:

This photo is from [slidecoaching.com](http://www.slidecoaching.com/2010/04/attraction-projection-screen/), which had this to say about it:

> Next time you are up on stage, remember to keep your eyes on the audience as much as possible. Your presentation will be better.

I couldn‚Äôt agree more. That's why I built Side Mirror.

### What's New in 2.0?

- The preview window is now _lightning_ fast! Up to 60 frames/sec. 
- You can now control the quality and zoom scale of the preview window, improving performance on older devices

So how much faster is it? Take a look:

I've been excited to get this out the door and hear how people are using it. If you've downloaded it, please let me know what you think!
