<p><em>Are you ready for the Dojo?</em></p><p><img src="/images/flyingsidekick.jpg" alt="photo by kaibara87 "  border="0" /><br><em>(</em><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kaibara/247465109/" target="_blank"><em>picture source</em></a><em>)</em></p><p>Whew!&nbsp; I’ve been busy lately!&nbsp; I’ve been wrapping up the content for the .NET Dojo class this Thursday (cutting it close, I know!).&nbsp; If you’re going to the class, you can get a jump start by grabbing all of the lab material at the google code site here:&nbsp; <a href="http://code.google.com/p/dojoblog">http://code.google.com/p/dojoblog</a>.</p><p>I created this site, called DojoBlog to reflect the sample project it contains, to allow attendees and anyone else interested to download the code and play with it.&nbsp; Keep in mind that the code may change last minute, so do a fresh update just before coming to class.</p><p>To download it you’ll need a subversion client, such as <a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/" target="_blank">TortoiseSVN</a>.&nbsp; The direct link to the repository is <a href="about:svn%20checkout%20http://dojoblog.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p>If you don’t have/want a subversion client, don’t worry.&nbsp; We’ll have the material ready on some USB sticks to circle around.&nbsp; Looking forward to seeing some of you there?&nbsp; <strong>Remember, it’s this Thursday, from 1pm to 4pm.</strong></p><p><b>UPDATE: I zipped up the material and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/dojoblog/downloads/list">released it</a> on the google code site.</b><br><strong></strong></p><p><img src="/images/pizza.jpg" alt="Photo by fooey"  border="0" /><br><em>(</em><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fooey/414244292/" target="_blank"><em>picture source</em></a><em>)</em><font color="#0000ff"></font></p><p><font color="#0000ff"></font>And after that, why not attend our August ALT.NET Geek Dinner?&nbsp; We’re holding it immediately after the .NET Dojo, so feel free to drop by, eat some good pizza, drink some good beer, and geek out on random topics.</p><p>Our venue is still <a href="http://www.starpizza.net/" target="_blank">Star Pizza</a>, located at 2111 Norfolk (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=2111+Norfolk+St,+Houston,+TX+77098&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=42.987658,59.853516&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=29.733079,-95.411196&amp;spn=0.011552,0.014613&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr" target="_blank">map</a>).&nbsp; <strong>The dinner starts at 6pm and ends around 8:30pm.</strong>&nbsp; This month, we’ll discuss:</p><ul><li>Code Clarity / Fluent Interfaces / Code without comments</li><li>Model View Presenter pattern</li><li>Continuous Integration</li></ul><p>Will you be there?&nbsp; Let us know in the comments!</p>
