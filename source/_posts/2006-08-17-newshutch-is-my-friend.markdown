<p>For my RSS Feeds I had previously used RssReader.&nbsp; I used it because I wanted a windows application that would notify me of new posts and not be too obtrusive.&nbsp; RssReader is pretty nice, but the interface needs quite a bit of polishing.&nbsp; I also disliked not having a distributed opml or something so that I could access all of my feeds on another computer.</p><p>I have since crossed over and succumbd to web-based RSS Feed readers.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve tried Google Reader, Newsgator, Bloglines, and others&hellip; but I didn&rsquo;t like any of them.</p><p>My new friend for RSS feeds is <a title="newshutch rss reader" href="http://newshutch.com/" target="_blank">Newshutch</a>.&nbsp; Incredbily simplistic, but functional.&nbsp; The interface doesn&rsquo;t get in my way and the nice use of Ajax means that I can leave the window open and it will automatically get my feeds for me.&nbsp; As I read an entry, I can click 1 button and have that entry fade away and the ones below it to float to the top.&nbsp; This fits nicely with the way I like to read blog posts, so this one is most-likely here to stay.</p>
