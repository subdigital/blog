The latest news just broke in the <a href="http://www.flux88.com/ImOnToYouMicrosoft.aspx">previously noted</a> Microsoft Conspiracy to Consume good open source project leaders.&nbsp; I'm sure you've heard it 10 times before me, but what the hell, what's 1 more?<br><br><a href="http://blog.wekeroad.com">Rob Conery</a>, creator of <a href="http://susonicproject.com">SubSonic</a> <a href="http://blog.wekeroad.com/2007/10/26/microsoft-subsonic-and-me/">is joining Microsoft full time to work on SubSonic</a>!&nbsp; I think this is great news.&nbsp; First, it reaffirms my belief that Microsoft has their eye dead on the community.&nbsp; Things are changing, and for the better, mark my words (muahahah).<br><br>I can't wait to see how this will affect the project, because I know that Rob has passion, and now that he doesn't have to worry about other projects, clients, or deadlines... he can focus and make SubSonic even better!<br><br>Who will be next?&nbsp; Speculate in the comments...<br><br><br><br><p></p>
