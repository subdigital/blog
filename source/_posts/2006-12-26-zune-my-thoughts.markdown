<p><img src="/images/zune_2Dblack_.jpg" hspace="4"  border="0"  />I received a black Zune for Christmas, despite it&rsquo;s lackluster sales and reviews by some.</p><p>I resisted getting an iPod for the longest time, because I wouldn&rsquo;t buy into the hype.</p><p>I compared a number of features to decide between a Zune and an 30gb iPod Video.</p><p><strong>Screen Size &ndash; </strong>The Zune has a very large screen compared to the iPod.&nbsp; For video you turn it sideways for a widescreen view, and it makes watching movies very do-able.</p><p><strong>Interface</strong> &ndash; Call me crazy, but I&rsquo;m not too fond of the iPod interface.&nbsp; When I used the iPod Video at the Apple Store, I was immediately annoyed that it asked me <em>every time</em> if I wanted TV on or TV off when I clicked on a video.&nbsp; The TV wasn&rsquo;t even connected!&nbsp; For a company so anal about usability, making the users make a redundant and unnecessary choice before showing videos is a no-no.&nbsp; The interface for the Zune is easy to use and the buttons make sense.&nbsp; The iPod isn&rsquo;t <em>bad<strong>, </strong></em>I just don&rsquo;t care for it very much.</p><p><strong>Wireless</strong> &ndash; I originally thought this was one of the coolest features of the Zune.&nbsp; It uses standard WiFi to transfer data between 2 Zunes, however it doesn&rsquo;t connect to my wireless network at home, which is a disappointment.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know anybody that has a Zune, so I haven&rsquo;t yet tried out the Social aspect of it.&nbsp; There are hacks that allow you to transfer a file unlimited times between Zunes wirelessly, but it involves registry hacks on the host computer, and renaming the file as an image.&nbsp; That makes it pretty much useless because I have a usb thumb drive in my pocket that can do the same thing easier.</p><p><strong>Podcasts </strong>&ndash; I&rsquo;ve become addicted to a number of podcasts, some with video, so I wanted good podcast support.&nbsp; I was disappointed to find that the Zune has almost NO notion of podcasts.&nbsp; Sure I can point the Zune software (which sucks, more on that later) to a folder where I download podcasts, but they don&rsquo;t live in a separate section on the Zune.&nbsp; I hope Microsoft fixes this in a future firmware update.&nbsp; iPod / iTunes wins on this hands-down.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m currently using uTorrent for BT feeds, and Doppler for video/audio feeds.&nbsp; These go into my <em>podcasts</em> folder which gets picked up by the Zune software.&nbsp; The video has to be re-encoded to the Zune format, which is annoying.&nbsp; I would think that WMV would be playable out of the box.</p><p><strong>Video</strong> &ndash; I originally dismissed Video as excessive in a portable player, but now it&rsquo;s my favorite feature.&nbsp; I have a lot of downloaded tv shows, and I plan on putting them on the Zune to watch while I work out.&nbsp; I ride an exercise bike to strengthen my leg and I can easily watch a TV show in that time.&nbsp; The problem I see now, however, is that my shows are in Divx or Xvid format, which I have to re-encode using <a title="Any Video Converter" href="http://www.any-dvd-converter.com/" target="_blank">Any Video Converter</a>&nbsp;to AVI or MPEG, then it has to be encoded <em>again</em> in the Zune format.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m hoping this process gets easier, or that the Zune will support Divx in the future.&nbsp; One thing that would be nice is if I could encode video <em>before I&rsquo;m ready to sync.</em>&nbsp; I find it annoying that I have to surrender my Zune for at least 30 minutes if I need to transfer a couple <a title="diggnation" href="http://diggnation.com/" target="_blank">diggnation</a> episodes.</p><p><strong>Music</strong> &ndash; This is a no-brainer for most MP3 players.&nbsp; Both the iPod and Zune have excellent usage in terms of usability.&nbsp; I like the large album art that is displayed during playback on the Zune, though I hear the new iPods do this as well.</p><p><strong>Size</strong> &ndash; The iPod wins in this category.&nbsp; The Zune is about 1/2&rdquo; thick, which is quite large.&nbsp; The iPod is about 1/4&rdquo; thick, so it&rsquo;s twice as thin.&nbsp; I decided that the other features were worth the trade-off in Size.</p><p><strong>PC Software &ndash; </strong>The Zune software sucks.&nbsp; Big time.&nbsp;&nbsp;It reminds me a lot of iTunes, but it doesn&rsquo;t really deliver.&nbsp; I ignore the Marketplace, so for me it&rsquo;s just a mechanism to transfer files over.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like to use MediaMonkey, but it&rsquo;s not supported yet.&nbsp; I found a few mistagged files while listening to music on the Zune, so I <strong>flagged</strong> them.&nbsp; They showed up in my Zune &ldquo;inbox&rdquo; the next time I sync&rsquo;ed.&nbsp; From there it shows me the file, but it doesn&rsquo;t let me edit the tags!&nbsp; How stupid is that?&nbsp; The only option I have is to delete the file and look at Properties, which is useless to me.&nbsp; </p><p>The Zune software also has zero support for subscribing to podcasts, let along distinguishing my podcasts between regular music aside from Genre.</p><p><strong>Audiobooks &ndash; </strong>I haven&rsquo;t yet tried listening to an Audiobook, however I plan on it.&nbsp; I listed to the Da Vinci code about 8 months ago and I loved it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m hoping that it will be easy to listen to Audiobooks.</p><p>All in all, you can&rsquo;t go wrong with an iPod or a Zune.&nbsp; Both are fantastic devices, and I am very happy with my Zune.&nbsp; I hope for a few improvements via firmware soon, but it&rsquo;s a new device and I think Microsoft will catch on soon.</p><p>Now, the question is&hellip; do I attempt the <a title="iPod mods 80gb zune upgrade" href="http://www.ipodmods.com/shop/zune-repair-guides.html" target="_blank">80gb mod</a>?</p>
