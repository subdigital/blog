<div style="clear:both;"></div>I must be really out of the loop.Even searching on google before I never ran into this until yesterday:NUnitASP.Whata cool extension.I must've been searching on the wrong terms because it's been out for over a year.Anyway it lets you grab pages and test things with full HtppContext so you can really test the front end behavior and be confident in your pages.<br /><br />Anyway, if there exists such a soul that has not heard/used ASP.NET unit testing before I suggest checking out NUnitASP.There's a pretty easy-to-follow tutorial at <a href="http://www.theserverside.net/articles/showarticle.tss?id=TestingASP">http://www.theserverside.net/articles/showarticle.tss?id=TestingASP</a><br /><br />Now to write tests for my 100+ pages... /quiver<br /><br />(on a side note I'm still looking for some practicle examples of testing my class library code with NUnit... I'm missing the bigger picture I think, but how can I easily test a class library that almost primarily deals with database interaction?? )<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
