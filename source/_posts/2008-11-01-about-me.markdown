<p>My name is Ben Scheirman. &nbsp;I am the Director of Development at <a href="http://www.chaione.com">ChaiONE</a> in Houston, TX.</p>
<p>I started out programming when I was 13, tinkering with QBASIC and creating simple games and screensavers. &nbsp;My favorite experience was creating a fake application called &quot;DELBUG&quot; that &quot;removes bugs from programs.&quot; &nbsp;It proceeded to tell the user that it had no choice but to format their hard drive. &nbsp;After that, I was hooked.</p>
<p>I took Computer Science classes all through high school, and then took the passion to college as well.&nbsp; I received a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Houston in 2004.</p>
<p>On this blog you&rsquo;ll find my random tidbits about software development as I evolve in my craft. &nbsp;Currently, I'm interested in agile practices such as test-driven development, refactoring, continuous integration, domain driven design, and more.&nbsp; I also frequently cover object-relational mapping concepts with NHibernate.&nbsp; I'm highly interested in both web and iPhone development.</p>
<p>My platforms of choice (in no particular order):&nbsp; .NET, Rails, iPhone</p>
<p>Languages:&nbsp; C#, Ruby, Objective-C, JavaScript, Boo</p>
<p>I wrote a   <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1933988622?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=flux88com-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1933988622">book</a><img width="1" height="1" border="0" style="border: medium none ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" alt="" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=flux88com-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1933988622" />&nbsp;(and a <a href="http://manning.com/palermo2/">2nd edition</a>)  and an <a href="http://pockettabs.com">iPhone app</a> that you might want to check out.</p>
<p>I enjoy reading, but the only thing that captures my attention are technical books.&nbsp; My reading list is growing faster than I can possibly read them! &nbsp;</p>
<p>I live in Houston with my wife and <strike>three</strike>&nbsp;<strong>five</strong> beautiful children.&nbsp; When I&rsquo;m not working, I&rsquo;m usually hanging out with my family, playing video games, or playing guitar.</p>
<p>Thanks for looking!</p>
