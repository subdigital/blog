I have the pleasure of speaking at [Cocoa Conf PDX](http://cocoaconf.com/portland-2013) on August 15-16th.
Cocoa Conf is always a great event, and I especially love traveling to my home state of Oregon.  This time around I'll be giving
two talks:

- The iOS Developer's Toolbelt
- Jenkins - Your personal butler for iOS automation

I hope to see you there!
