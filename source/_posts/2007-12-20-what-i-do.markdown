<p>Looks like a new blog meme is starting…&nbsp; I was tagged by my good friend <a href="http://www.sheysrebellion.net/blog/2007/11/20/what-do-you-do/" target="_blank">Shey</a> who’s wanting to know what we all do. (sorry it took me so long to respond!)</p><p>So…&nbsp; what would you say… you DO here?</p><p><img src="/images/office_2Dspace_2Dwhat_2Ddo_2Dyou_2Ddo.png" alt="Office-space-what-do-you-do"  border="0" /></p><p>Well, I’m a consultant, so my role sometimes changes.&nbsp; Currently I’m a lead developer for an energy company, involved in a Lotus Notes to .NET Migration.</p><p>There are roughly 80 applications, some targeted for SharePoint 2007, some custom ASP.NET, and some Windows Forms.</p><p>We decided to use <a href="http://subsonicproject.com/" target="_blank">SubSonic</a> for data access.&nbsp; Most of my readers know that I’m a DDD bigot and prefer persistence ignorant business entities and yada-yada-yada.&nbsp; But sometimes you just have a simple domain model and there’s no reason to go into the effort of introducing <a href="http://nhibernate.sf.net/" target="_blank">NHibernate</a> on a team that’s unfamiliar with ORM’s in general.&nbsp; (NHibernate just has too steep of a learning curve).&nbsp; SubSonic shines with simple domain models, and it allows us to be very productive very quickly.</p><p>In retrospect I think I would have favored using <a href="http://castleproject.org/" target="_blank">Castle ActiveRecord</a>.&nbsp; We wouldn’t benefit from code-gen unless we made some custom templates for CodeSmith, but the main point would be that we can decouple the database from the application code.&nbsp; It turned out that some database naming standards were in place that favored very common abbreviations for just about any type of database column.&nbsp; This resulted in polluting our object model with poor names and I implemented a cheap work-around using partial classes and vanity properties.&nbsp; But the stink is still present <img src="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/smile1.gif">.</p><p>We’re also using Team System, which is a less than desirable experience in my opinion.&nbsp; TFS SCC is okay, but it’s no <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_blank">Subversion</a>.&nbsp; We do our database development with DB Pro and I’ve found that to be&nbsp;both a blessing and a hinderance.&nbsp; I’m starting to realize that with all of this tooling that MSFT is selling, a better experience can be had with a bit of patience, process maturity, and some open source software.</p><p><em>Where’s all the good info on DB Pro anyway?&nbsp; All I’ve found are press release/feature list blogs and links to marketing material.</em></p><p>For testing we’re using MSTest, and if I had it my way I’d rip it all out and replace it with NUnit.&nbsp; MSTest is more annoying than its worth, and we’re not using any of the build quality features anyway, so we wouldn’t be missing out on anything.&nbsp; I use <a href="http://testdriven.net/" target="_blank">TestDriven.NET</a> so I never even see the VS Test Runner.</p><p>For the build process we use <a href="http://nant.sf.net/" target="_blank">NAnt</a>, but we haven’t setup continuous integration.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Frankly because I haven’t had the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;(I can hear the argument that I don’t have time NOT to already). &nbsp;I have targets setup to build up the database&nbsp;(both incremental and from scratch), generate code with SubSonicCommander, compile all of the source and run the tests.&nbsp; Continuous Integration is the next logical step, and I hope I can implement it soon.</p><p>In summary, here are the tools, frameworks and libraries that I’m using:</p><ul><li>SubSonic</li><li>NAnt</li><li>WCF</li><li>VSTS 2005 + DB Pro</li><li>TFS Source Control</li><li>Prototype / Scriptaculous (for most ajax and dhtml stuff)</li><li>ASP.NET Ajax / Control Toolkit (for UpdatePanel and the Calendar)</li><li>MSTest (yuck)</li><li>Enterprise Library Logging</li><li>RhinoMocks</li><li>TestDriven.NET</li><li>Console2!</li></ul><p>To get this thing spreading like wild-fire, I’m going to tag…</p><p><a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/jason_meridth/" target="_blank">Jason Meredith</a><br><a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/evan_hoff/" target="_blank">Evan Hoff</a><br><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/bsimser/" target="_blank">Bil Simser</a><br><a href="http://graysmatter.codivation.com/" target="_blank">Justice Gray</a>&nbsp;(<em>keep it professional Justice!&nbsp; No weekend details!</em>)<br><a href="http://www.pseale.com/blog/" target="_blank">Peter Seale</a></p><p>…get to it guys!&nbsp; What do YOU do?</p>
