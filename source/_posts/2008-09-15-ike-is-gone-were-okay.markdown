<p>Thanks to all who checked in with me during hurricane Ike.&nbsp; My family and I are okay, and we're now in Dallas awaiting restoration of power.&nbsp; During the storm I still had Edge connectivity on my iPhone, so I was checking local tweets with Twinkle, and it was very interesting to see what folks within 10 miles of me were saying.&nbsp; What a cool feature.&nbsp; </p> <p>As for damage, our house is fine.&nbsp; Luckily, all we lost was our fence!&nbsp; Some houses weren't so lucky.</p> <p>Here are some pics that I took with my phone:</p> <p><a href="http://flux88.com/uploads/IkeisGoneWereOkay_79A5/HurricaneIke001.jpg"><a href="http://flux88.com/uploads/IkeisGoneWereOkay_79A5/HurricaneIke006.jpg"><img src="/images/HurricaneIke006_thumb.jpg" alt="Hurricane Ike 006"  border="0" /></a><img src="/images/HurricaneIke001_thumb.jpg" alt="Hurricane Ike 001"  border="0" /></a><a href="http://flux88.com/uploads/IkeisGoneWereOkay_79A5/HurricaneIke004.jpg"><img src="/images/HurricaneIke004_thumb.jpg" alt="Hurricane Ike 004"  border="0" /></a><a href="http://flux88.com/uploads/IkeisGoneWereOkay_79A5/HurricaneIke005.jpg"><img src="/images/HurricaneIke005_thumb.jpg" alt="Hurricane Ike 005"  border="0" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://flux88.com/uploads/IkeisGoneWereOkay_79A5/HurricaneIke009.jpg"><img src="/images/HurricaneIke009_thumb.jpg" alt="Hurricane Ike 009"  border="0" /><a href="http://flux88.com/uploads/IkeisGoneWereOkay_79A5/HurricaneIke010.jpg"><a href="http://flux88.com/uploads/IkeisGoneWereOkay_79A5/HurricaneIke010_3.jpg"><a href="http://flux88.com/uploads/IkeisGoneWereOkay_79A5/HurricaneIke.jpg"><img src="/images/HurricaneIke_thumb.jpg" alt="Hurricane Ike"  border="0" /></a></a><img src="/images/HurricaneIke010_thumb.jpg" alt="Hurricane Ike 010"  border="0" /><a href="http://flux88.com/uploads/IkeisGoneWereOkay_79A5/HurricaneIke002.jpg"><img src="/images/HurricaneIke002_thumb.jpg" alt="Hurricane Ike 002"  border="0" /></a></a></a> </p> <p>My wife took some pictures with a much better camera, so I'll link to those soon.&nbsp; Time to clean up!</p>
