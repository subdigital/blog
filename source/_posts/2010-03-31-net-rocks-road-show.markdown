<p><a href="http://dotnetrocks.com" target="_blank">Carl and Richard</a> are at it again.&#160; I went to the Houston HDNUG meeting back in 2005 When they did the Visual Studio 2005 Road Show.&#160; It was great fun, they had some cool prizes, and good presentations.</p>  <p>Well they’re <a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/roadtrip.aspx" target="_blank">doing it again</a>!&#160; They will be in Houston at the Microsoft Office on April 26th.&#160; They’ll be driving their Geek RV across the country talking about Visual Studio 2010.&#160; Checkout the impressive map of the tour:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.dotnetrocks.com/roadtrip/route.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="/images/route_3_.jpg" alt="route"  height="483"  /></a> </p>  <p>Come check it out!&#160; Oh, and one lucky participant will get to ride in the Geek RV for one stop!&#160; If you’re interested, register <a href="https://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032448352&amp;Culture=en-US" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
