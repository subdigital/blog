<p>Oy.</p><p>My hard drive that stored my subversion repository burned up.&nbsp; No, really.&nbsp; It <strong>burned</strong> up.&nbsp; I saw smoke coming from one of the ICs on the PCB.</p><p>The drive is still under warranty, but I don&rsquo;t care about the drive.&nbsp; Hard drives are cheap.&nbsp; This contained three large personal projects, a <strong>boatload</strong> of mp3s, tax&nbsp;documents from the last 3 years, and unfortunately something non-replaceable:&nbsp; A recording of my mom singing a lullaby that she wrote.</p><p>I spoke to some data recovery people, and I got prices ranging from $1000 &ndash; $2500, and they are pretty confident in getting the data back.&nbsp; The problem is that I am trying to save money for my wedding, and shelling out a grand for data recovery is out of the question at this time.</p><p>My other option is to buy an <strong>identical</strong> drive and just replace the PCB.&nbsp; It looks easy enough, but I need to make sure that the PCB is the exact same one.&nbsp; From what it looks like, there&rsquo;s only 4 solder points, going directly <em>into</em> the drive controlling the heads.&nbsp; </p><p>What should I do?&nbsp; Should I attempt this ghetto-recovery?&nbsp; Should I pay the $1k?</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
