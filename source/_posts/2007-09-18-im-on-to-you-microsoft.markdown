There's a conspiracy going on here.&nbsp; We all ignored the first signs ofit, but now it's too apparent to ignore.&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft is engaging insome devious master plan that will affect most of us.<br><br>We all read with shock and awe, Scott Hanselman's post <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/BlueBadge.aspx">where he announced he was becoming a blue badge</a>.&nbsp; People wondered what this would do to his blog content, or his contribution to <a href="http://dasblog.info">DasBlog</a>.&nbsp; This was the first sign.&nbsp; And we did NOTHING.<br><br>Today, I saw the 2nd sign, and I'm going to expose this Microsoft conspiracy for what it is.&nbsp; Phil Haack <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2007/09/17/why-is-microsoft-removing-my-mvp-status.aspx">just announced</a> that he is joining the ranks as a Microsoft employee.&nbsp; That's right, you heard me.&nbsp; <br><br><b>Microsoft has hired the technical and charismatic leaders of the two most popular open source blogging platforms for .NET</b>.&nbsp;This is all a part of a master plan to squash the multi-billion dollarmarket so that Microsoft alone can swim in the sea of money that is tobe made from .NET open source blogging.&nbsp; Don't kid yourself, there is <b>buku </b>(TM) money to be made in this area.<br><br>Sure,both Phil and Scott claim to stay committed to SubText and DasBlog,respectively.&nbsp; But we all know better.&nbsp; Soon they will be hard at work,<b>developing the most incredible blogging platform ever devised</b>.&nbsp; I even have a name for this stealth-assassin project.&nbsp; It will likely be called <i>Microsoft Collaborative Team Works For Online Weblogs Framework Foundation </i><i>System 2008</i>.&nbsp; I can just hear Microsoft Marketing salivating at that title.<br><br>Allkidding aside, I think that Microsoft is going to be changing it'simage, especially in the ASP.NET arena.&nbsp; They've snatched up some <i><b>key</b></i> individuals in the community and they will definitely be making waves.&nbsp; You can quote me on that.<br><p></p>
