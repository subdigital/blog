<p>The pizza was good and the conversation was even better.&nbsp; We had 9 people show up and we talked a lot about tech, Microsoft, Test Driven Development, and beer!</p> <p>I brought up the subject of possibly organizing an ALT.NET Open Spaces conference here in Houston, and folks seemed interested.&nbsp; I'm a little frightened by the amount of work this will be, but in the end I think it will be worth it.&nbsp; We also decided on getting a google group setup, so if you're in the Houston area (or just want to listen in) then join us at <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/houstonaltdotnet" target="_blank">http://groups.google.com/group/houstonaltdotnet</a>.&nbsp; We'll use this for future planning.</p> <p>Unfortunately I forgot to take a picture of the group, whoops!&nbsp; I guess that just means we'll have to meet again :)</p>
