<p>I'm not the <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/jQuerytoshipwithASPNETMVCandVisualStudio.aspx" target="_blank">first</a> <a href="http://baley.codebetter.com/blogs/kyle.baley/archive/2008/09/28/asp-net-mvc-and-jquery-can-now-produce-legitimate-offspring.aspx" target="_blank">person</a> to <a href="http://blog.wekeroad.com/blog/jquery-and-visual-studio-bff/" target="_blank">report this</a>, but Scott Guthrie recently announced that <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/09/28/jquery-and-microsoft.aspx" target="_blank">jQuery will ship with Visual Studio 10</a>.&nbsp; <strong>This is huge news</strong>.&nbsp; When I talk to an audience about javascript, most people I talk to have never used a javascript library.&nbsp; Now I'm excited to have the ability to talk at length about jQuery and not have people raise their eyebrows at me and tell me that they hate javascript.</p> <p>Recently at the ASP Insiders Summit I asked how many people actually <em>like</em> coding in javascript.&nbsp; About 6 people (out of 30) raised their hands.&nbsp; I then asked, "How many of you use jQuery?"&nbsp; The same 6 kept their hands in the air.&nbsp; Postulate what you want, this can either mean:</p> <blockquote> <p>jQuery makes you love javascript again.</p></blockquote> <p>or...</p> <blockquote> <p>Those who love javascript, choose jQuery.</p></blockquote> <p>Though I won't laugh in your face, <a href="http://graysmatter.codivation.com/PermaLink,guid,f65b3bd2-d56b-4985-8102-a89b60e5fb3f.aspx" target="_blank">like some</a> :), but I will gently suggest that if you aren't yet familiar with jQuery, <strong>now is the time to learn</strong>.&nbsp; I can recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/jQuery-Action-Bear-Bibeault/dp/1933988355" target="_blank">jQuery in Action</a> if you're serious about it, but a simple <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=active&amp;rlz=1C1GGLS_enUS291&amp;q=learn+jquery&amp;btnG=Search" target="_blank">Google search</a> will get you most of what you need.</p> <p>The other reason why this is big news, is that soon you'll be able to open up product support issues with Microsoft about jQuery.&nbsp; Let that sink in for a second.&nbsp; An open source project, under the MIT license, will be fully supported by Microsoft.</p> <p>I applaud Microsoft for making this decision.&nbsp; It's not your typical Microsoft anymore.</p>
