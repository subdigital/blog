<p>&#160;</p>  <p><img src="/images/iphone-mov_3.png" align="left"  height="519"  /> </p>  <p>On Tuesday (7/14/2009) we had our monthly geek dinner where we get together, have beer &amp; pizza, and talk about technology.&#160; Usually it is centered around .NET, but lately I’ve been doing some development on the iPhone, so I thought I’d give a demo &amp; talk about how it relates to .NET developers.</p>  <p>In the video I talk about:</p>  <ul>   <li>How to use Interface Builder to build the UI visually. </li>    <li>How to hook up IBOutlets and IBActions from the view controller to the view elements in Interface Builder </li>    <li>How to do animation with CoreAnimation </li>    <li>How to create &amp; position views programmatically </li> </ul>  <p>There is also some random discussion about the capabilities on the phone, what the APIs are like for the various features, and how some of this relates to .NET and C#.</p>  <p>Unfortunately I forgot to hit record when I was doing a primer on Objective-C, so if you need that, then I suggest reading <a href="http://cocoadevcentral.com/d/learn_objectivec/" target="_blank">this article</a>.&#160; <em>(In fact, read up all of <a href="http://cocoadevcentral.com/" target="_blank">Cocoa Dev Central</a> because it’s a great resource.)</em></p>  <p>The 2nd demo I did I didn’t immediately give credit to (I did later off camera) but I wanted to make sure that I give credit to the original author, over at <a href="http://appsamuck.com/" target="_blank">AppsAmuck.com</a>.&#160; They have a great series called 31 Days of iPhone.&#160;&#160; The demo I did can be found <a href="http://appsamuck.com/day9.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Here is the video:</p> <object width="400" height="300"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=5642740&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00ADEF&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=5642740&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00ADEF&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="400" height="300"></embed></object>  <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/5642740">Intro to iPhone Development</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user1579700">Ben Scheirman</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>A bunch of people asked me how I learned all of this.&#160; First, I read this book:</p> <iframe style="width: 120px; height: 240px" marginheight="0" src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&amp;bc1=FFFFFF&amp;IS2=1&amp;npa=1&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;fc1=000000&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;t=flux88com-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;m=amazon&amp;f=ifr&amp;md=10FE9736YVPPT7A0FBG2&amp;asins=0321503619" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>  <p>It’s a great read, and really helped me grasp programming in Objective-C.</p>  <p>I also took the Standford iTunesU course – <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs193p/cgi-bin/index.php" target="_blank">CS193P – iPhone Application Development</a>.&#160; This was tremendously valuable.&#160; The best part?&#160; It’s 100% free!</p>
