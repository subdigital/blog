<p>I <a href="http://flux88.com/blog/teaser-hellip/" target="_blank">previously hinted</a> at an application that I was working on, but wasn’t ready to disclose details.&#160; I have reached a point where I am ready to show what I’ve been working on this past summer.</p>  <p>The basic idea is this:&#160; <em>Guitar Tablature in your pocket, wherever you are</em>.&#160; </p>  <p>If you don’t know what tablature, check <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablature" target="_blank">this Wikipedia entry</a>.</p>  <h2>Pocket Tabs for iPhone</h2>  <p>Pocket Tabs is an iPhone application that aims to be a guitarists companion.&#160; Often times I’ve found myself with a guitar but not in front of a computer.&#160; I know many songs, but usually I need to look them up to refresh my memory before I can play them again.</p>  <p><a href="http://flux88.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/AnnouncingPocketTabsforiPhone_A15/Finder_2.png" target="_blank"><img src="/images/Finder_thumb_.png" alt="Finder"  height="480"  /></a></p>  <p>Pocket Tabs allows you to search for tabs online and view them in a hands-free fashion.&#160; You can even save the tabs to your device so that they’ll be available without an internet connection.&#160; This is perfect for camping, where internet connections are sparse, but guitars are plenty!&#160; It is also useful for iPod Touch owners.&#160; They can load up tabs to their device while they’re on Wi-Fi, and have them ready wherever they are.</p>  <p><a href="http://flux88.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/AnnouncingPocketTabsforiPhone_A15/iPhone%20Simulator%206_2.png"><img src="/images/iPhone%20Simulator%206_thumb__.png" alt="iPhone Simulator 6"  height="480"  /></a> </p>  <p><a href="http://flux88.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/AnnouncingPocketTabsforiPhone_A15/iPhone%20Simulator%203_2.png"><img src="/images/iPhone%20Simulator%203_thumb_.png" alt="iPhone Simulator 3"  height="480"  /></a> </p>  <p>A cool feature that I’m really proud of is “Auto-Scroll”.&#160; Most of the time you’ll be using both of your hands to play the guitar, so this allows you to scroll at a set speed automatically.</p>  <p><a href="http://flux88.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/AnnouncingPocketTabsforiPhone_A15/iPhone%20Simulator%202_2.png"><img src="/images/iPhone%20Simulator%202_thumb_.png" alt="iPhone Simulator 2"  height="480"  /></a> </p>  <p><a href="http://flux88.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/AnnouncingPocketTabsforiPhone_A15/iPhone%20Simulator_4.png"><img src="/images/iPhone%20Simulator_thumb_1_.png" alt="iPhone Simulator"  height="480"  /></a> </p>  <h2>Submit Tabs Online!</h2>  <p>Pocket Tabs searches it’s companion website, <a href="http://pockettabs.com">http://pockettabs.com</a> for tablature.&#160; These are user-submitted tabs &amp; chords, so if there isn’t a song you like available, you’re free to submit it at <a href="http://pockettabs.com/submit">http://pockettabs.com/submit</a>.</p>  <h2>I Need Beta Testers</h2>  <p>I’m getting ready to release a beta version, and I need a few beta testers.&#160; So if you play guitar, have an iPhone or iPod Touch, and want to help out, please send an email to beta[AT]pockettabs[DOT]com to express your interest.</p>  <p>I am planning on getting 20-30 beta testers, so get your requests in as soon as possible.&#160; I’ll then send out an email with instructions on how to get started with the beta.</p>  <p>   <p></p>    <p></p>    <p></p>    <p></p>    <p></p>    <p>&#160;</p>    <p>What do you think?&#160; Let me know in the comments!</p></p>
