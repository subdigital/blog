<p>Well the day has arrived.&nbsp; Our book has finally been submitted to print and it should be in stores on September 7th.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m very happy to be finished with the book.&nbsp; I think there are a lot of great books on ASP.NET MVC, yet ours still stands out as it targets a different audience than the other books.</p>
<p>In the book you&rsquo;ll find our (sometimes opinionated) views on application development, architecture, separation of concerns, emphasis on testing, MvcContrib, NHibernate, StructureMap, and more.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll also learn plenty about the extension points of the framework, as we take you through many examples to illustrate the topic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m especially proud of the Routing and Ajax chapters, which have received warm reviews during the early PDF drops.</p>
