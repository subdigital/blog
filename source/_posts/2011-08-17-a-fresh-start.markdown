So I've been thinking of ditching the traditional blog for a while now.  My [current blog](http://flux88.com) is hosted on WordPress, which 
is powerful enough, however it always seems like a hassle to maintain.

This time I'm going in a completely new direction.  This blog is powered by [Octopress](http://octopress.org) (which uses [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) as the engine.

Posts are composed in Markdown (I'm using vim to write this) and the blog is then deployed to a git repository for publishing.

Will it make me blog more?  I hope so, but only time will tell!
