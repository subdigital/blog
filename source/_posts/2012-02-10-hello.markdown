[NSScreencast](http://nsscreencast.com) is now live. The first 2 videos have been posted:

- [Objective-C Basics](http://nsscreencast.com/episodes/1-objective-c-basics)
- [Diagnosing Memory Problems](http://nsscreencast.com/episodes/2-diagnosing-memory-problems)

Now that the site has launched, I can share more details with you about it.

### A new video each week
Each week, a new video will be posted covering a single, focused topic related to iOS development. 

### Don't waste the listener's time
Each video will be short and to the point. It boils down to this: a 20 minute video is an easy thing to watch.  A 60-minute video is a serious time commitment.

### Some Free, Some Paid
Eventually, NSScreencast will be a subscription service.  I'll announce details once they are nailed down, but for now, enjoy the videos!
If you'd like to be notified when an episode is released, you can [subscribe to the RSS feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/NSScreencast), 
or follow [@nsscreencast](http://twitter.com/nsscreencast) on twitter.  (_Subscribing in iTunes is coming soon_)

If you have any video topic suggestions, feel free to share them at the [User Voice Forum](http://nsscreencast.uservoice.com).
Seriously, I'd love to hear your feedback!
