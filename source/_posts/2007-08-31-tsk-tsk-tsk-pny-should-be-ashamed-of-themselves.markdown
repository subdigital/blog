<p>Take a look at one of my co-workers found today.&nbsp; The screenshot says it all.</p><p><a href="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/tsk_2Dtsk.jpg"><img src="/images/tsk_2Dtsk_thumb_.jpg" alt="Tsk-tsk"  border="0"  /></a></p><p><em>No, I didn&rsquo;t destroy their database.&nbsp; I was about to send an email to them when I realized it was fixed.</em></p><p>It amazes me that a large company such as PNY would do this.&nbsp; It was probably written in Taiwan by someone who makes $4/hour, but still.&nbsp; It makes you think twice before buying PNY memory.</p>
