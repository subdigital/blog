<p>I just got home after attending a talk by Robert Martin on Code Quality.&nbsp; It was really great to meet him after reading his book, to which I gave an excellent <a href="http://www.flux88.com/ReviewAgilePrinciplesPatternsAndPracticesInC.aspx">review</a>.</p><p>Bob (that&rsquo;s what people call him when you know him, kind of like Bob De Niro, though I don&rsquo;t know him at all &mdash; what was I saying?) is very animated and pretty weird.&nbsp; He pulled out his geek card a few times which was funny.&nbsp; He even acted out a scene from Star Trek 2 where he was Ricardo Monteban.&nbsp; Yeah.</p><p>Anyway, the talk was very much like his book and enjoyed it thoroughly.&nbsp; It was also good to see other folks in the room interested in agility from around Houston.&nbsp; Most of them were .NET developers.</p><p>Robert Martin will be in town again next month giving a similar (but different) talk about clean code, possibly with Ruby.&nbsp; Hopefully I will be able to attend that as well.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll leave you with some&nbsp;R.M. quotes&hellip; </p><p><em>&ldquo;Not cleaning up your code is like not doing the dishes after dinner.&nbsp; The longer you wait, the more the mess piles up.&nbsp; Eventually it impedes you so much that you can&rsquo;t even work&rdquo;</em></p><p>&ldquo;<em>Having management dictate a specific code coverage percentage is madness.&nbsp; Code Coverage is a great tool for developer feedback, but mandating it will not provide value.&rdquo;</em></p><p>&ldquo;<em>The great redesign in the sky fails &mdash; always.&rdquo;</em></p><p>&ldquo;<em>So you want to clean up some code but it is just a mess?&nbsp; Uh [snickering] do you have tests?&nbsp; No?&nbsp; Your pretty much screwed.. [smiles]&rdquo; &mdash; </em>after which the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Robert-Martin/dp/0131177052" target="_blank">Working Effectivly with Legacy Code</a> was recommended.</p><p><em>&ldquo;Professionals write tests &mdash; first&rdquo;</em></p>
