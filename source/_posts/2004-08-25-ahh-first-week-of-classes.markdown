<div style="clear:both;"></div>There is nothing like the bombardment of fraternaties and organizations that hound you into joining or donating or whatever.I often see signs like NBSA (National Black Student Association)or HSA (Hispanic Student Association)...and there are many others.In fact, I think there is one for just about every race out there, except white.Why is this?Because if there was a National White Student Association, it would be considered racist.Hrm, what is wrong with us?<br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
