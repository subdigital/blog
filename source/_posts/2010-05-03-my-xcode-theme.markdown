<p>If you haven’t heard, I’ve been contributing videos to <a href="http://tekpub.com">Tekpub</a> about <a href="http://tekpub.com/videos/iphone">iPhone Development</a>.&#160; A few folks have asked me what theme I use for Xcode.</p>  <p>I created a modified dark theme loosely based on <a href="http://railscasts.com">Ryan Bates</a>’ excellent <a href="http://railscasts.com/about" target="_blank">Railscasts theme for Textmate</a>.</p>  <p>Here is a screenshot of the theme:</p>  <p><img src="/images/xcaststheme.png_3.jpg" alt="xcaststheme.png"  height="412"  /> </p>  <p>I’m calling this theme “Xcasts”.&#160; You can download it here:&#160; <a title="https://flux88.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/XCasts.xccolortheme" href="https://flux88.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/XCasts.xccolortheme">XCasts.colortheme</a>.&#160; This file needs to go in <strong>~/Library/Application Support/Xcode/Color Themes</strong> (however I’d bet if you double click on it, it would copy it for you.&#160; Tell me in the comments if that works :)).</p>
