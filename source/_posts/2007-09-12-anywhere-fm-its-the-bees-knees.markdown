I don't know how they do it.&nbsp; Somehow, the most-excellent <a href="http://anywhere.fm">http://anywhere.fm</a> <b>allows you to upload your entire music catalog </b>onto their servers and play it on the web.&nbsp; Their bandwidth costs must be outrageous.<br><br><i>On a side note, isn't it weird that these web2.0 startups such as this one or YouTube have the most backwards business model?&nbsp; Let's spend an outrageous amount of money and give away our applications, ad-free.&nbsp; I always laugh at the one-liner "Step 2: Profit!" but this is even worse than that!&nbsp; I think the business model here is, build a gigantoid (that's my word, you can't take it) user-base, then hope that google will buy us out.&nbsp; If all else fails we can start injecting subliminal messages to our advertisers.&nbsp; <br><br>"How I wish, how I wish you were here (with Tylenol).&nbsp; Cuz we're just... two lost souls looking for some Lysol.... year after year....Running over the same old ground, but have we found.... the same old beers, Wish you were here (with Viagra)"</i><br><br>The have a pretty usable flash clone of iTunes, and it allows me to listen to my music library wherever I am (which is great for a consultant).&nbsp; Sometimes my Zune runs out of batteries, or sometimes I forget it at home.&nbsp; Anywhere.fm rocks.&nbsp; It's the bee's knees!<br><br>Here's a screenshot of the player:<br><br><img src="http://www.flux88.com/uploads/anywhere-fm.png"><br><br>You can also listen to my library as a radio station by navigating to <a href="http://anywhere.fm/subdigital">http://anywhere.fm/subdigital</a>.&nbsp; Just don't make fun of my music :)<br><p></p>
