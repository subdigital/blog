<div style="clear:both;"></div>Read my first published article <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/aspnet/ControlInjector.asp">here</a> at CodeProject. I developed a ControlInjector for applying a String.Format() pattern to server controls, mixing html literal content and private controls.<br /><br />The benefit is similar to the benefit of String.Format(), where you separate the string itself, and the variables to insert.<br /><br />Let me know what you think of it!<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
