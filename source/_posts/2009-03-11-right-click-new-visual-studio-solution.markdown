<p>I've often struggled with the way that Visual Studio's Blank Solution template creates projects.&nbsp; Essentially you're given a folder for the solution, and projects go inside of it.&nbsp; When you consider the fact that most projects have a host of other things related to it, not just source code, the structure found in most open source projects is more appealing.</p> <p>For an example, this is what I'm talking about:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><img src="/images/image_3__.png" alt="image"  border="0" /> </p> <p>The project is well-organized and has places for build artifacts, 3rd party assemblies, documentation, etc.</p> <p>For new projects, I find myself frequently performing these steps:</p> <ul> <li>Open Visual Studio, File -&gt; New Project, Blank Solution  <li>Close Visual Studio  <li>Navigate to the folder in Explorer  <li>Create a new folder called src  <li>Move the .sln file into the src folder  <li>Double-click the new .sln file</li></ul> <p>Today I figured out how to just add a new right-click menu option in Windows Explorer.&nbsp; It involved a simple registry hack, and a little hex editing.&nbsp; The end result:</p> <p><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="545" alt="" src="http://flux88.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/RightclickNewVisualStudioSolution_E781/image_6.png" width="729" border="0"> </p> <p>Choosing this new option adds a new file and opens it for rename:</p> <p><img src="/images/image_7c77b2e2-9224-41f5-9d5e-90f3217d7063_.png" alt="image"  border="0" /> </p> <p>Rename the file, and presto!</p> <p><img src="/images/image_8ddbb0d4-934e-4cf5-95ef-1383dee243a5_.png" alt="image"  border="0" /> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>To add this to your system, copy &amp; run this registry file (make sure remove the .txt):&nbsp; <a href="http://flux88.com/uploads/right-click-sln.reg.txt" target="_blank">right-click-sln.reg</a></p> <p>Of course, you should be sure to back up your registry before running this file.&nbsp; I'm not responsible for jacking up your system :).&nbsp; Tested on XP SP3 &amp; Vista x64 SP1.</p>
