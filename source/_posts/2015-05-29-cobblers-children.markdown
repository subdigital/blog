...or something like that. I find it amusing how true the old adage is:

> The cobbler’s children have no shoes.

Which of course refers to the fact that busy professionals often produce their work to the outside world, but rarely do they take the time to build something for themselves.

I find this to be true for myself, however I’m trying hard to battle it.

As an iOS developer, I want to have apps in the store. Currently for me, those are [Giggle Touch](http://giggletouch.com) and [Side Mirror](http://sidemirrorapp.com), both of which I’m proud of, but of course I’d love to have more. Part of this is pure vanity, as it *feels good* to have your work on display. It certainly isn’t for the money. The biggest reason for me is advertisement of my personal <marco voice>braaand</marco voice>. Having apps in the store shows you know what you’re doing and that you can take a concept all the way to completion.

As an independent freelancer, I build apps and websites for clients, but until yesterday I hadn’t yet built a website for my own business.

The site doesn’t do anything except reflect what’s on my business cards. But it’s a step in the right direction.

It’s missing a page about me, a page about work I’ve done, and a page with availability. This is all valuable information, but step one is getting something out there that you’re proud of. For me, the bare minimum is just a nice logo with a statement about what I do.

You can see it over at [ficklebits.com](http://ficklebits.com).  It is built on [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and is [open source](https://github.com/ficklebits/site), because why not?
