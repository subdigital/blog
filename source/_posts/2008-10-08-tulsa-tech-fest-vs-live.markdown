NVelocity!" and 4 others said "You'll just confuse people."&nbsp; If you have an opinion on the matter, chime in in the comments!<br></li> <li><a href="http://techfests.com/Tulsa/2008/Speakers/BenScheirman/default.aspx" target="_blank">Becoming a .NET Jedi with ReSharper</a><br>I was asked to fill in for a speaker, so I decided to just give an off-the-cuff praise-fest for ReSharper.&nbsp; This tool demos so well, and I'm happy to recommend it to eager developers looking to improve their craft.</li></ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><a href="http://flux88.com/uploads/TulsaTechFestVSLive_148B3/lasvegas.jpg"><img src="/images/lasvegas_thumb_.jpg" alt="las-vegas"  border="0" /></a></p> <p>The following week, I'll be at <a href="http://vslive.com/2008/lasvegas/" target="_blank">VS Live in Las Vegas</a> (Vegas, baby, Vegas!)&nbsp; This is my first time going&nbsp; to Vegas, so I'm super-pumped.&nbsp; My session at VS Live is on Tuesday morning...</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://http://vslive.com/2008/lasvegas/webdevelopment.aspx#mvc" target="_blank">Test-Driven Development with ASP.NET MVC</a><br>I'm excited to give this sort of talk to a larger audience.&nbsp; There are a number of interesting points to talk about with respect to testability in software, and how you can cope with software that is not very testable.&nbsp; This talk will benefit people familiar with ASP.NET MVC where they'll learn lots about unit testing, mocks, and test-first development.&nbsp; People experienced with TDD will be able to appreciate the ASP.NET MVC framework, seeing first-hand how testable it is out of the box.</li></ul> <p>If you're going to either of these conferences, please come by and chat!</p>
