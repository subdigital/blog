<p>My latest assignment at work was somewhat small, and the requirements were fairly straightforward so I got to work immediately.&nbsp; My early requests to meet with my user were met with &ldquo;let&rsquo;s get a demo first.&rdquo;&nbsp; Given the availability of all parties involved, this took longer than I would have liked.</p><p>So here I am, 60 work-hours later, I have a fully functional, ready-to-deploy application, and I have yet to meet with my user.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s sincerely hope he doesn&rsquo;t decide that this isn&rsquo;t what he wanted in the first place.</p><p>Then my office-mate recognized our new development process.&nbsp; Ladies and gentlement, I give you <strong>Eliga!</strong>&nbsp; </p><p>Eliga is the opposite of agile.&nbsp; Here is our manifesto: </p><p><em>Forget users, they will only slow me down!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t disturb me when I&rsquo;m coding you peons!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll hear your impressions when I&rsquo;m finished!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t be bothered with workflow changes!&nbsp; They&rsquo;re already coded and set in stone!</em></p>
