<p><a href="http://www.benday.com/" target="_blank">Benjamin Day</a>&nbsp;spoke at Visual Studio live this year and was interviewed by Channel 9.&nbsp; He talks about NHibernate.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t know what NHibernate is, it&rsquo;s an object-relational mapper aiming to reduce/eliminate common data access code.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s based on the mature Hibernate for Java, and has growing community support.</p><p>Anyway, Ben Day and I used to shoot ideas back and forth and talk about NHibernate patterns and limitations.&nbsp; He mentions me in the podcast (!), which you can download <a title="channel 9" href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Showpost.aspx?postid=165139" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p>Thanks Ben!</p>
