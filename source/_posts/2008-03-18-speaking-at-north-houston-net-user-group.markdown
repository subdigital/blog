<p><font style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #f4f4f4">Sorry for the late notice on this one (it sort of snuck up on me!)&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be speaking at the North Houston .NET User Group (yes I said North, it&rsquo;s new).&nbsp; The talk is scheduled for Thursday, March 20th @ 6:30PM.&nbsp; The meeting will be held at Montgomery College in The Woodlands.</font></p><p>I will talk about adopting agile development&hellip; the what, why, and&nbsp;how.&nbsp; Hopefully it will be more of an interactive discussion, as there the audience can usually relate to the pain points that I talk about with traditional waterfall development.</p><p>For more details, check out <a href="http://nhdnug.org/" target="_blank">their website</a>.</p>
