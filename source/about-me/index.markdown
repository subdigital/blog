My name is Ben Scheirman. I am an experienced software developer from Houston, TX. I spend most
of my time these days writing Objective-C, Swift, and Ruby.

I’m a [regular speaker](/speaking) at developer conferences all over the world. If you want to
book me to speak at a conference, [get in touch](mailto:ben@scheirman.com?subject=Speaking).

I started out programming when I was about 13, tinkering with QBASIC and creating simple games and screensavers. My favorite
experience was creating a fake application called “DELBUG” that “removes bugs from programs.”
It proceeded to tell the user that it had no choice but to format their hard drive. After that, I was hooked.

I took Computer Science classes all through high school, then took the passion to college as well.
I received a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Houston in 2004.

From 2004-2010 I was an avid .NET developer, becoming an ASP Insider in 2008 and eventually a Microsoft MVP in ASP.NET in 2008 and 2009.
I wrote two books on ASP.NET MVC, which was an _interesting_ process.

In 2009 I started becoming interested in iPhone development, so I picked up a few books, watched some online videos, and eventually wrote
my first app, Pocket Tabs. It became pretty popular, rising to #8 in the music category for one week. However, due to legal pressure, I
decided to take it off of the store due to the unfortunate copyright laws around guitar tablature. In 2010, I released my 2nd app, [Giggle Touch](http://giggletouch.com).
I enjoyed the process of writing iPhone apps, and my part time interest with Ruby on Rails allowed me to make a career shift to doing that full time.  So in 2010 I left
a nice job as a .NET consultant to explore the crazy fun world working at a small company on technologies I love.

These days I spent most of my time creating screencasts over at [NSScreencast](http://nsscreencast.com). I also do iOS and Rails consulting under my company, [Fickle Bits, LLC](http://ficklebits.com).

I live in Houston with my wife and five beautiful children. When I’m not working, I’m usually hanging out with my family, programming for fun, or playing guitar.
