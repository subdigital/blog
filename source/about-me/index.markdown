My name is Ben Scheirman.  I am the Director of Development at ChaiONE in Houston, TX.

I enjoy writing great software using Ruby and Objective-C.  I’m a fairly regular speaker at conferences covering Rails, iPhone, and .NET.

I started out programming when I was 13, tinkering with QBASIC and creating simple games and screensavers.  My favorite experience was creating a fake application called “DELBUG” that “removes bugs from programs.”  It proceeded to tell the user that it had no choice but to format their hard drive.  After that, I was hooked.

I took Computer Science classes all through high school, and then took the passion to college as well.  I received a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Houston in 2004.

From 2004-2010 I was an avid .NET developer, becoming an ASP Insider in 2008 and eventually a Microsoft MVP in ASP.NET in 2008 and 2009.
I wrote 2 books on ASP.NET MVC (first edition | second edition), which was an interesting process.

In 2009 I started becoming interested in iPhone development, so I picked up a few books, watched some online videos, and eventually wrote my first app, Pocket Tabs.  It became pretty popular, rising to #8 in the music category for 1 week.  However, due to legal pressure, I decided to take it off of the store due to the unfortunate copyright laws around guitar tablature.  In 2010, I released my 2nd app, Giggle Touch.
I enjoyed the process of writing iPhone apps, and my part time interest with Ruby on Rails allowed me to make a career shift to doing that full time.  So in 2010, I left a nice job as a .NET consultant to explore the crazy fun world working at a small company on technologies I love.
I live in Houston with my wife and five beautiful children.  When I’m not working, I’m usually hanging out with my family, programming for fun, or playing guitar.
Thanks for looking!
