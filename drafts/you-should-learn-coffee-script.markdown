# You Should Learn Coffee Script

You've probably heard of CoffeeScript already. At [Lone Star Ruby
Conf](http://lonestarrubyconf.com) there were at least _three_ talks
that mentioned it as something you should be considering.

If you haven't heard of CoffeeScript yet, check out the [official site
here](http://coffeescript.org).  I'll quote their introductory paragraph:

> CoffeeScript is a little language that compiles into JavaScript. Underneath all of those embarrassing braces and semicolons, JavaScript has always had a gorgeous object model at its heart. CoffeeScript is an attempt to expose the good parts of JavaScript in a simple way.

CoffeeScript is based around the premise that JavaScript isn't a
_terrible_ language (the contrary, in fact) - it just has too many
rough edges that make its use cumbersome to do correctly.

If you don't know what I'm talking about them you've probably never
compared The Complete Javascript Reference to Javascript: The Good
Parts.
